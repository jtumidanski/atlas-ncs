1002000_LITH_HARBOR_1=The town you are at is Lith Harbor! Alright I'll explain to you more about #bLith Harbor#k. It's the place you landed on Victoria Island by riding The Victoria. That's Lith Harbor. A lot of beginners who just got here from Maple Island start their journey here.
1002000_LITH_HARBOR_2=It's a quiet town with the wide body of water on the back of it, thanks to the fact that the harbor is located at the west end of the island. Most of the people here are, or used to be fisherman, so they may look intimidating, but if you strike up a conversation with them, they'll be friendly to you.
1002000_LITH_HARBOR_3=Around town lies a beautiful prairie. Most of the monsters there are small and gentle, perfect for beginners. If you haven't chosen your job yet, this is a good place to boost up your level.
1002000_PERION_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bPerion#k. It's a warrior-town located at the northern-most part of Victoria Island, surrounded by rocky mountains. With an unfriendly atmosphere, only the strong survives there.
1002000_PERION_2=Around the highland you'll find a really skinny tree, a wild hog running around the place, and monkeys that live all over the island. There's also a deep valley, and when you go deep into it, you'll find a humongous dragon with the power to match his size. Better go in there very carefully, or don't go at all.
1002000_PERION_3=If you want to be a #bWarrior#k then find #rDances with Balrog#k, the chief of Perion. If you're level 10 or higher, along with a good STR level, he may make you a warrior after all. If not, better keep training yourself until you reach that level.
1002000_ELLINIA_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bEllinia#k. It's a magician-town located at the far east of Victoria Island, and covered in tall, mystic trees. You'll find some fairies there, too. They don't like humans in general so it'll be best for you to be on their good side and stay quiet.
1002000_ELLINIA_2=Near the forest you'll find green slimes, walking mushrooms, monkeys and zombie monkeys all residing there. Walk deeper into the forest and you'll find witches with the flying broomstick navigating the skies. A word of warning: Unless you are really strong, I recommend you don't go near them.
1002000_ELLINIA_3=If you want to be a #bMagician#k, search for #rGrendel the Really Old#k, the head wizard of Ellinia. He may make you a wizard if you're at or above level 8 with a decent amount of INT. If that's not the case, you may have to hunt more and train yourself to get there.
1002000_HENESYS_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bHenesys#k. It's a bowman-town located at the southernmost part of the island, made on a flatland in the midst of a deep forest and prairies. The weather's just right, and everything is plentiful around that town, perfect for living. Go check it out.
1002000_HENESYS_2=Around the prairie you'll find weak monsters such as snails, mushrooms, and pigs. According to what I hear, though, in the deepest part of the Pig Park, which is connected to the town somewhere, you'll find a humongous, powerful mushroom called Mushmom every now and then.
1002000_HENESYS_3=If you want to be a #bBowman#k, you need to go see #rAthena Pierce#k at Henesys. With a level at or above 10 and a decent amount of DEX, she may make you be one after all. If not, go train yourself, make yourself stronger, then try again.
1002000_KERNING_CITY_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bKerning City#k. It's a thief-town located at the northwest part of Victoria Island, and there are buildings up there that have just this strange feeling around them. It's mostly covered in black clouds, but if you can go up to a really high place, you'll be able to see a very beautiful sunset there.
1002000_KERNING_CITY_2=From Kerning City, you can go into several dungeons. You can go to a swamp where alligators and snakes are abound, or hit the subway full of ghosts and bats. At the deepest part of the underground, you'll find Lace, who is just as big and dangerous as a dragon.
1002000_KERNING_CITY_3=If you want to be a #bThief#k, seek #rDark Lord#k, the heart of darkness of Kerning City. He may well make you a thief if you're at or above level 10 with a good amount of DEX. If not, go hunt and train yourself to reach there.
1002000_NAUTALIS_1=Here's a little information on #b#m120000000##k. It's a submarine that's currently parked in between Ellinia and Henesys in Victoria Island. That submarine serves as home to numerous pirates. You can have just as beautiful a view of the ocean there as you do here in Lith Harbor.
1002000_NAUTALIS_2=#m120000000# is parked in between Henesys and Ellinia, so if you step out just a bit, you'll be able to enjoy the view of both towns. All the pirates you'll meet in town are very gregarious and friendly as well.
1002000_NAUTALIS_3=If you are serious about becoming a #bPirate#k, then you better meet the captain of #m120000000#, #r#p1090000##k. If you are over Level 10 with 20 DEX, then she may let you become one. If you aren't up to that level, then you'll need to train harder to get there!
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_1=Alright I'll explain to you more about #bSleepywood#k. It's a forest town located at the southeast side of Victoria Island. It's pretty much in between Henesys and the ant-tunnel dungeon. There's a hotel there, so you can rest up after a long day at the dungeon ... it's a quiet town in general.
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_2=In front of the hotel there's an old buddhist monk by the name of #rChrishrama#k. Nobody knows a thing about that monk. Apparently he collects materials from the travelers and create something, but I am not too sure about the details. If you have any business going around that area, please check that out for me.
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_3=From Sleepywood, head east and you'll find the ant tunnel connected to the deepest part of the Victoria Island. Lots of nasty, powerful monsters abound so if you walk in thinking it's a walk in the park, you'll be coming out as a corpse. You need to fully prepare yourself for a rough ride before going in.
1002000_SLEEPYWOOD_4=And this is what I hear ... apparently, at Sleepywood there's a secret entrance leading you to an unknown place. Apparently, once you move in deep, you'll find a stack of black rocks that actually move around. I want to see that for myself in the near future ...
1002002_HAVE_YOU_HEARD=Have you heard of the beach with a spectacular view of the ocean called #bFlorina Beach#k, located near Lith Harbor? I can take you there right now for either #b1500 mesos#k, or if you have a #bVIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k with you, in which case you'll be there for free.\r\n\r\n#L0##b I'll pay 1500 mesos.#l\r\n#L1# I have a VIP Ticket to Florina Beach.#l\r\n#L2# What is a VIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k?#l
1002002_UNFINISHED_BUSINESS=You must have some business to take care of here. You must be tired from all that traveling and hunting. Go take some rest, and if you feel like changing your mind, then come talk to me.
1002002_VIP_TICKET=So you have a #bVIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k? You can always head over to Florina Beach with that. Alright then, but just be aware that you may be running into some monsters there too. Okay, would you like to head over to Florina Beach right now?
1002002_HOW_TO_VIP=You must be curious about a #bVIP Ticket to Florina Beach#k. Haha, that's very understandable. A VIP Ticket to Florina Beach is an item where as long as you have in possession, you may make your way to Florina Beach for free.

1012005_TRANSFER_POINTS=In order to transfer the pet ability points, closeness and level, Pet AP Reset Scroll is required. If you take this\r\nscroll to Mar the Fairy in Ellinia, she will transfer the level and closeness of the pet to another one. I am especially giving it to you because I can feel your heart for your pet. However, I can't give this out for free. I can give you this book for 250,000 mesos. Oh, I almost forgot! Even if you have this book, it is no use if you do not have a new pet to transfer the Ability points.
1012005_CANT_GIVE_TOO_MUCH_LIFE=But Water of Life only comes out little at the very bottom of the World Tree, so I can't give him too much time in life... I know, it's very unfortunate... but even if it becomes a doll again I can always bring life back into it so be good to it while you're with it.
1012005_TRY_HARD_RAISING_IT=Talk to the pet, pay attention to it and its intimacy level will go up and eventually his overall level will go up too. As the intimacy level rises, the pet's overall level will rise soon after. As the overall level rises, one day the pet may even talk like a person a little bit, so try hard raising it. Of course it won't be easy doing so...
1012005_AFTER_SOME_TIME=After some time... that's correct, they stop moving. They just turn back to being a doll, after the effect of magic dies down and Water of Life dries out. But that doesn't mean it's stopped forever, because once you pour Water of Life over, it's going to be back alive.
1012005_DO_YOU_REALLY_WANT_TO_BUY=250,000 mesos will be deducted. Do you really want to buy?
1012005_OH_YEA_THEY_REACT=Oh yeah, they'll react when you give them special commands. You can scold them, love them... it all\r\ndepends on how you take care of them. They are afraid to leave their masters so be nice to them, show them love. They can get sad and lonely fast...
1012005_THEY_HAVE_HUNGER=It may be a live doll but they also have life so they can feel the hunger too. #bFullness#k shows the level of hunger the pet's in. 100 is the max, and the lower it gets, it means that the pet is getting hungrier. After a while, it won't even follow your command and be on the offensive, so watch out over that.
1012005_SAD_TO_SEE_THEM_STOP=Even if it someday moves again, it's sad to see them stop altogether. Please be nice to them while they are alive and moving. Feed them well, too. Isn't it nice to know that there's something alive that follows and listens to only you?
1012005_NEED_EMPTY_SLOT_AND_ENOUGH_MESOS=Please check if your inventory has empty slot or you don't have enough mesos.
1012005_NEED_PET_FOOD=Oh yes! Pets can't eat the normal human food. Instead my disciple #bDoofus#k sells #bPet Food#k at the Henesys Market so if you need food for your pet, find Henesys. It'll be a good idea to buy the food in advance and feed the pet before it gets really hungry.
1012005_FEED_ON_REGULAR_BASIS=Oh, and if you don't feed the pet for a long period of time, it goes back home by itself. You can take it out of its home and feed it but it's not really good for the pet's health, so try feeding him on a regular basis so it doesn't go down to that level, alright? I think this will do.
1012006_DO_YOU_HAVE_BUSINESS=Do you have any business with me?\r\n#L0##bPlease tell me about this place.#l\r\n#L1#I'm here through a word from Mar the Fairy...#k#l
1012006_TOO_BUSY=Hmmm ... too busy to do it right now? If you feel like doing it, though, come back and find me.
1012006_GET_THAT_LETTER=Get that letter, jump over obstacles with your pet, and take that letter to my brother Trainer Frod. Give him the letter and something good is going to happen to your pet.
1012006_WANNA_TRAIN_YOUR_PET=This is the road where you can go take a walk with your pet. You can just walk around with it, or you can train your pet to go through the obstacles here. If you aren't too close with your pet yet, that may present a problem and he will not follow your command as much... So, what do you think? Wanna train your pet?
1012006_ARE_YOU_SURE_YOUVE_MET_MAR=Hey, are you sure you've met #bMar the Fairy#k? Don't lie to me if you've never met her before because it's obvious. That wasn't even a good lie!!
1012006_OH_HERE=Ok, here's the letter. He wouldn't know I sent you if you just went there straight, so go through the obstacles with your pet, go to the very top, and then talk to Trainer Frod to give him the letter. It won't be hard if you pay attention to your pet while going through obstacles. Good luck!
1012007_BROTHERS_LETTER=Eh, that's my brother's letter! Probably scolding me for thinking I'm not working and stuff...Eh? Ahhh...you followed my brother's advice and trained your pet and got up here, huh? Nice!! Since you worked hard to get here, I'll boost your intimacy level with your pet.
1012007_BROTHER_TOLD_ME=My brother told me to take care of the pet obstacle course, but ... since I'm so far away from him, I can't help but wanting to goof around ...hehe, since I don't see him in sight, might as well just chill for a few minutes.
1012007_DID_YOU_REALLY=Hmmm ... did you really get here with your pet? These obstacles are for pets. What are you here for without it?? Get outta here!
1012007_WHAT_DO_YOU_THINK=What do you think? Don't you think you have gotten much closer with your pet? If you have time, train your pet again on this obstacle course...of course, with my brother's permission.
1012008_NEED_A_BREATHER=Hey, you look like you need a breather. You should be enjoying the life, just like I am. Well, if you have a couple of items, I can trade you for an item you can play mini games with. Now... what can I do for you?#b\r\n#L0#Create a mini game item#l\r\n#L1#Explain to me what the mini games are about#l#k
1012008_YOU_WANT_TO_MAKE=You want to make the mini game item? Mini games aren't something you can just go ahead and play right off the bat. For each mini game, you'll need a specific set of items. Which minigame it em do you want to make?#b\r\n#L4#Omok Set#l\r\n#L5#A Set of Match Cards#l#k
1012008_WANT_TO_LEARN_MORE=You want to learn more about the mini games? Awesome! Ask me anything. Which mini game do you want to know more about?#b\r\n#L2#Omok#l\r\n#L3#Match Cards#l#k
1012008_OMOK_RULES=Here are the rules for Omok, so listen carefully. Omok is a game in which you and your opponent take turns laying a piece on the table until someone finds a way to lay 5 consecutive pieces in a line, be it horizontal, diagonal, or vertical. For starters, only the ones with an #bOmok Set#k can open a game room.
1012008_MATCH_CARD_RULES=Here are the rules for Match Cards, so listen carefully. As the name suggests, Match Cards is simply finding a matching pair among the number of cards laid on the table. When all the matching pairs are found, then the person with more matching pairs will win the game. Just like Omok, you'll need #bA set of Match Cards#k to open the game room.
1012008_OMOK_NEEDS=You want to play #bOmok#k, huh? To play it, you'll need the Omok Set. Only the ones with that item can open the room for a game of Omok, and you can play this game almost anywhere except for a few places at the market place.
1012008_MATCH_CARD_NEEDS=You want #bA set of Match Cards#k? Hmm...to make A set of Match Cards, you'll need some #bMonster Cards#k. Monster Card can be obtained by taking out the monsters all around the island. Collect 15 Monster Cards and you can make a set of A set of Match Cards.
1012008_OMOK_COST=Every game of Omok will cost you #r100 mesos#k. Even if you don't have an #bOmok Set#k, you can enter the room and play. However, if you don't possess 100 mesos, then you won't be allowed to enter in the room at all. The person opening the game room also needs 100 mesos to open the room (or else there's no game). If you run out of mesos during the game, then you're automatically kicked out of the room!
1012008_MATCH_CARD_COST=Every game of Match Cards will cost you #r100 mesos#k. Even if you don't have #bA set of Match Cards#k, you can enter the room and play. However, if you don't possess 100 mesos, then you won't be allowed to enter in the room at all. The person opening the game room also needs 100 mesos to open the room (or else there's no game). If you run out of mesos during the game, then you're automatically kicked out of the room!
1012008_HOW_TO_START=Enter the room, and when you're ready to play, click on #bReady#k.\r\nOnce the visitor clicks on #bReady#k, the room owner can press #bStart#k to begin the game. If an unwanted visitor walks in, and you don't want to play with that person, the room owner has the right to kick the visitor out of the room. There will be a square box with x written on the right of that person. Click on that for a cold goodbye, okay?
1012008_OMOK_MATERIALS=#bYou want to make #t{0}##k? Hmm...get me the materials, and I can do just that. Listen carefully, the materials you need will be: #r{1} #t{2}#, {3} #t{4}#, 1 #t{5}##k. The monsters will probably drop those every once in a while...
1012008_OMOK_START=When the first fame starts, #bthe room owner goes first#k. Be warned that you'll be given a time limit, and you may lose your turn if you don't make your move on time. Normally, 3 x 3 is not allowed, but if there comes a point that it's absolutely necessary to put your piece there or face ending the game, then you can put it there. 3 x 3 is allowed as the last line of defense! Oh, and it won't count if it's #r6 or 7 straight#k. Only 5!
1012008_MATCH_CARD_START=Oh, and unlike Omok, when you create the game room for Match Cards, you'll need to set your game on the number of cards you'll use for the game. There are 3 modes available, 3x4, 4x5, and 5x6, which will require 12, 20, and 30 cards respectively. Remember that you won't be able to change it up once the room is open, so if you really wish to change it up, you may have to close the room and open another one.
1012008_REDO_OR_TIE=If you know your back is against the wall, you can request a #bRedo#k. If the opponent accepts your request, then you and your opponent's last moves will cancel out. If you ever feel the need to go to the bathroom, or take an extended break, you can request a #btie#k. The game will end in a tie if the opponent accepts the request. Tip: this may be a good way to keep your friendships in tact.
1012008_MOVE_ON_TIME=When the first game starts, #bthe room owner goes first.#k Beware that you'll be given a time limit, and you may lose your turn if you don't make your move on time. When you find a matching pair on your turn, you'll get to keep your turn, as long as you keep finding a pair of matching cards. Use your memorizing skills to make a streak.
1012008_NEXT_GAME=When the next game starts, the loser will go first. Also, no one is allowed to leave in the middle of a game. If you do, you may need to request either a #bforfeit or tie#k. (Of course, if you request a forfeit, you'll lose the game.) And if you click on 'Leave' in the middle of the game and call to leave after the game, you'll leave the room right after the game is over. This will be a much more useful way to leave.
1012008_LONGER_STREAK=If you and your opponent have the same number of matched pairs, then whoever had a longer streak of matched pairs will win. If you ever feel the need to go to the bathroom, or take an extended break, you can request a #btie#k. The game will end in a tie if the opponent accepts the request. Tip: this may be a good way to keep your friendships in tact.
1012008_WHICH_SET=The set also differs based on what kind of pieces you want to use for the game. Which set would you like to make?{0}
1012100_HALL_OF_FAME=You have walked a long way to reach the power, wisdom and courage you hold today, haven't you? What do you say about having right now #ra NPC on the Hall of Fame holding the current image of your character#k? Do you like it?
1012100_HALL_OF_FAME_FEE=You have walked a long way to reach the power, wisdom and courage you hold today, haven't you? What do you say about having right now #ra NPC on the Hall of Fame holding the current image of your character#k? Do you like it? I can do it for you, for the fee of #b{0} mesos.#k
1012100_1ST_JOB=So you decided to become a #rbowman#k? There are some standards to meet, y'know... #bYour level should be at least 10, with at least {0}#k. Let's see.
1012100_2ND_JOB_TEST=Hmmm... you have grown a lot since I last saw you. I don't see the weakling I saw before, and instead, look much more like a bowman now. Well, what do you think? Don't you want to get even more powerful than that? Pass a simple test and I'll do just that for you. Do you want to do it?
1012100_2ND_JOB_GO_SEE=Go and see the #b#p1072002##k.
1012100_2ND_JOB_BREEZE=Haha...I knew you'd breeze through that test. I'll admit, you are a great bowman. I'll make you much stronger than you're right now. before that, however... you;ll need to choose one of two paths given to you. It'll be a difficult decision for you to make, but... if there's any question to ask, please do so.
1012100_3RD_JOB=There you are. A few days ago, #b#p2020010##k of Ossyria talked to me about you. I see that you are interested in making the leap to the amazing world of the third job advancement for archers. To achieve that goal, I will have to test your strength in order to see whether you are worthy of the advancement. There is an opening in the middle of a deep forest in Victoria Island, where it'll lead you to a secret passage. Once inside, you'll face a clone of myself. Your task is to defeat her and bring #b#t4031059##k back with you.

1012100_STRONGER_NOW=You've gotten much stronger now. Plus every single one of your inventories have added slots. A whole row, to be exact. Go see for it yourself. I just gave you a little bit of #bSP#k. When you open up the #bSkill#k menu on the lower left corner of the screen, there are skills you can learn by using SP's. One warning, though: You can't raise it all together all at once. There are also skills you can acquire only after having learned a couple of skills first.
1012100_PROUD_BOWMAN=Now a reminder. Once you have chosen, you cannot change up your mind and try to pick another path. Go now, and live as a proud Bowman.
1012100_CHOOSE_OCCUPATION=Alright, when you have made your decision, click on [I'll choose my occupation] at the bottom.#b\r\n#L0#Please explain to me what being the Hunter is all about.\r\n#L1#Please explain to me what being the Crossbowman is all about.\r\n#L3#I'll choose my occupation!
1012100_TAKE_MY_LETTER=Good decision. You look strong, but I need to see if you really are strong enough to pass the test, it's not a difficult test, so you'll do just fine. Here, take my letter first... make sure you don't lose it!

1012100_NEED_TO_BE_STRONG={0} need to be strong. But remember that you can't abuse that power and use it on a weakling.

I'll be waiting for you.
1012100_CLONE=Since she is a clone of myself, you can expect a tough battle ahead. He uses a number of special attacking skills unlike any you have ever seen, and it is your task to successfully take him one on one.

1022000_MAKE_UP_YOUR_MIND=Make up your mind and visit me again.

1022000_TRAIN_MORE=Train a bit more until you reach the base requirements and I can show you the way of the #rWarrior#k.
1022000_GO_YOUNG_WARRIOR=From here on out, you are going to the Warrior path. This is not an easy job, but if you have discipline and confidence in your own body and skills, you will overcome any difficulties in your path. Go, young Warrior!
1022000_MAKE_INVENTORY_ROOM=Make some room in your inventory and talk back to me.
1022000_GOTTEN_STRONGER=You've gotten much stronger now. Plus every single one of your inventories have added slots. A whole row, to be exact. Go see for it yourself. I just gave you a little bit of #bSP#k. When you open up the #bSkill#k menu on the lower left corner of the screen, there are skills you can learn by using SP's. One warning, though: You can't raise it all together all at once. There are also skills you can acquire only after having learned a couple of skills first.
1022000_REMINDER=Now a reminder. Once you have chosen, you cannot change up your mind and try to pick another path. Go now, and live as a proud Warrior.

1022000_FIGHTER_INFO=Warriors that master #rSwords or Axes#k.\r\n\r\n#rFighters#k get #bRage#k, which boosts your party's weapon attack by 10. During 2nd job this is strongly appreciated, as it is free (except for -10 wep def, which is not going to impact the damage you take much at all), takes no Use slots and increases each party member's damage (except Magicians) by several hundreds. The other classes can give themselves a weapon attack boost as well, but need items to do so. #rFighters#k also get #bPower Guard#k, reducing touch damage by 40% and deals it back to the monster. This is the main reason why #rFighters#k are considered soloers is because this reduces pot costs immensely.
1022000_PAGE_INFO=Warriors that master #rSwords or Maces/Blunt weapons#k.\r\n\r\n#rPages#k get #bThreaten#k, a skill that lowers the enemies' weapon defense and weapon attack by 20; this is mostly used to lower damage dealt to you. Pages also get #bPower Guard#k, reducing touch damage by 40% and deals it back to the monster. This is one of the main reason why #bPages/WKs#k are considered solo players, that's because this reduces pot costs immensely. Of course, constant KB and #bIce Charge#k helps also to the soloing factor.
1022000_SPEARMAN_INFO=Warriors that master #rSpears or Polearms#k.\r\n\r\n#rSpearmen#k get #bHyper Body#k, which boosts your max HP/MP and that of your party by 60% when maxed. This skill is particularly useful for helping partied Thieves, Archers, and Magicians to survive more hits from enemies and/or PQ bosses. They also get #bIron Will#k which gives +20 wep def and +20 mag def for 300 sec. It is basically a nerfed Bless with 100 seconds more duration but gives no accuracy or avoidability bonus. Even with this skill maxed, it isn't even close to being in the same league as Power Guard and is why Spearmen/Dark Knights are not considered a soloing class.
1022000_CHOOSE_JOB=Now... have you made up your mind? Please choose the job you'd like to select for your 2nd job advancement. #b\r\n#L0#Fighter\r\n#L1#Page\r\n#L2#Spearman

1022000_FIGHTER_SUCCESS=Alright, you have now become the #bFighter#k. A fighter strives to become the strongest of the strong, and never stops fighting. Don't ever lose that will to fight, and push forward 24/7. I'll help you become even stronger than you already are.
1022000_PAGE_SUCCESS=Alright, you have now become a #bPage#k! Pages have high intelligence and bravery, which I hope you'll employ throughout your journey to the right path. I'll help you become much stronger than you already are.
1022000_SPEARMAN_SUCCESS=Alright, you have now become the #bSpearman#k. The Spearman use the power of darkness to take out the enemies, always in shadows... Please believe in yourself and your awesome power as you go in your journey. I'll help you become much stronger than you are right now.
1022000_BOOK_GIVEN=I have just given you a book that gives you the list of skills you can acquire as a {0}. Also your etc inventory has expanded by adding another row to it. Your max HP and MP have increased, too. Go check and see for it yourself.
1022000_SP_GIVEN=I have also given you a little bit of #bSP#k. Open the #bSkill Menu#k located at the bottom left corner. you'll be able to boost up the newer acquired 2nd level skills. A word of warning, though. You can't boost them up all at once. Some of the skills are only available after you have learned other skills. Make sure yo remember that.
1022000_BECOME_STRONG={0} need to be strong. But remember that you can't abuse that power and use it on a weakling. Please use your enormous power the right way, because... for you to use that the right way, that is much harden than just getting stronger. Please find me after you have advanced much further. I'll be waiting for you.
1022000_CLONE_INFO=My the other self is quite strong. He uses many special skills and you should fight with him 1 on 1. However, people cannot stay long in the secret passage, so it is important to beat him ASAP. Well... Good luck I will look forward to you bringing #b#t4031059##k to me.

2020008_ANSWER_EACH_AND_EVERY_QUESTION=You'll need to answer each and every question given to you with honesty and conviction. If you correctly answer all the questions, then the Holy Stone will formally accept you and hand you #b#t4031058##k. Bring back the necklace, and I will help you to the next step forward. Good luck.

20205_MAKE_INVENTORY_ROOM=If you wish to receive the medal befitting the title, you may want to make some room in your equipment inventory.
20205_SUCCESS=You are now no longer a Knight-in-Training. You have now officially become a Cygnus Knight.
20205_GIVEN_SP=I have also given you some #bSP#k and the accompanying skills of a Thunder Breakers that are only available to the official knights. These skills are lightning-based, so use them wisely!
20205_ACT_LIKE_ONE=Well, personally, I hope you don't lose your enthusiasm even after becoming the Cygnus Knights. Always seek out the positive even if you're in the midst of a barrage of negative items.
2022004_GREAT_JOB=You did a great job back there, {0}, well done. Now I will transport you back to El Nath. Have the pendant in your possession and talk to me when you feel ready to receive the new skill.
2023000_NOT_CHEAP=Hmm, please think this over. It's not cheap, but you will NOT be disappointed with our premier service!
2023000_HELLO=Hello there! This taxi will take you to dangerous places in Ossyria faster than an arrow! We go from #m{0}# to #b#m{1}##k on this Ossyria Continent! It'll cost you #b{2} meso#k. I know it's a bit expensive, but it's well worth passing all the dangerous areas!
2023000_WOULD_YOU_LIKE_TO=Would you like to pay #b{0} mesos#k to travel to the #b#m{1}##k?
2023000_NOT_ENOUGH_MESOS=You don't seem to have enough mesos. I am terribly sorry, but I cannot help you unless you pay up. Bring in the mesos by hunting more and come back when you have enough.
2030000_FURTHER_AND_DEEPER=Hey, you look like you want to go farther and deeper past this place. Over there, though, you'll find yourself surrounded by aggressive, dangerous monsters, so even if you feel that you're ready to go, please be careful. Long ago, a few brave men from our town went in wanting to eliminate anyone threatening the town, but never came back out...
2030000_IF_YOU_EVER_CHANGE_YOUR_MIND=Even if your level's high it's hard to actually go in there, but if you ever change your mind, please find me. After all, my job is to protect this place.
2030000_DO_YOU_WANT_TO_GO=If you are thinking of going in, I suggest you change your mind. But if you really want to go in... I'm only letting in the ones that are strong enough to stay alive in there. I do not wish to see anyone else die. Let's see... Hmmm...! You look pretty strong. All right, do you want to go in?
2030000_YOU_ARE_TOO_WEAK=If you are thinking of going in, I suggest you change your mind. But if you really want to go in... I'm only letting in the ones that are strong enough to stay alive in there. I do not wish to see anyone else die. Let's see... Hmmm... You haven't reached Level 50 yet. I can't let you in, then, so forget it.
1209002_CALM_DOWN=Please calm down, uncle. We are embarking to #bVictoria Island#k, we will be safe once we reach there. So, come on!
12101_TOWN_CALLED_AMHERST=This is the town called #bAmherst#k, located at the northeast part of the Maple Island. You know that Maple Island is for beginners, right? I'm glad there are only weak monsters around this place.
12101_GO_TO_SOUTHPERRY=If you want to get stronger, then go to #bSouthperry#k where there's a harbor. Ride on the gigantic ship and head to the place called #bVictoria Island#k. It's incomparable in size compared to this tiny island.
12101_YOU_CAN_CHOOSE_YOUR_JOB=At the Victoria Island, you can choose your job. Is it called #bPerion#k...? I heard there's a bare, desolate town where warriors live. A highland...what kind of a place would that be?
20000_THIS_IS_EXHILARATING=Ah, you've come... this is exhilarating. I am grateful for your decision to become a Cygnus Knight. I have been waiting a long time for someone like you. Someone that is courageous enough to face the Black Magician and not flinch...
20000_BATTLE_AGAINST_EVIL=The battle against the evil nature of the Black Magician who wants to swallow up Maple World as a whole, the cunning nature of his disciples, and the physical battle against the crazy monsters will await you. There will also come a time where even you may turn against yourself into an enemy and torment you ...
20000_I_AM_CONFIDENT=But I won't worry about that. I am confident that you will be able to fight through all that and protect Maple World from the Black Magician. Of course, you'll have to become a bit stronger than you are right now, right?
20001_WELCOME_TO_THE_CYGNUS_KNIGHTS=Hello, #h #. I formally welcome you to the Cygnus Knights. My name is Neinheart Von Rubistein, the Head Tactician for the young Empress. I will be seeing you often from here on out, so I suggest you remember my name. Haha...
20001_I_WILL_EXPLAIN=I understand that you didn't have enough time and exposure to figure out what you really need to do as a Cygnus Knight. I will explain it to you in detail, one by one. I will explain where you are, who the young Empress is, and what our duties are...
20001_ISLAND_CALLED_EREVE=You're standing on an island called Ereve, the only land that's governed by the young Empress that also happens to float in the air. Yes, we're floating in the air as we speak. We stay here out of necessity, but it usually works as a ship that floats all over Maple World, for the sake of the young Empress...
20001_YOUNG_EMPRESS=The young Empress is indeed the ruler of Maple World, the one and only governor of this world. What? You've never heard of such a thing? Ahhh, that's understandable. The young Empress may govern this world, but she's not a dictator that looms over everyone. She uses Ereve as a way for her to oversee the world as an observer without having to be too hands-on. That's how it usually is, anyway...
20001_HAVE_TO_TAKE_CONTROL=But situations arise every now and then where she'll have to take control. The evil Black Magician has been showing signs of resurrection all over the world. The very king of destruction that threatened to destroy the world as we know it is trying to reappear into our lives.
20001_PROBLEM_IS=The problem is, no one is aware of it. It's been so long since the Black Magician disappeared, that people have become used to peace in the world, not necessarily knowing what to do if a crisis like this reaches. If this keeps up, our world will be in grave danger in no time.
20001_GROUP_OF_KNIGHTS=That's when the young Empress decided to step forward and take control of this potential crisis before it revealed itself. She decided to create a group of Knights that will prevent the Black Magician from being fully resurrected. I'm sure you know of what happens afterwards since you volunteered to become a Knight yourself.
20001_DUTIES_ARE_SIMPLE=Our duties are simple. We need to make ourselves more powerful; much more powerful than the state we're in right now, so that when the Black Magician returns, we'll battle him and eliminate him once and for all before he puts the whole world in grave danger. That is our goal, our mission, and therefore yours as well
20001_UNDERSTOOD=This is the basic overview of this situation. Understood?
20001_I_AM_GLAD=I'm glad you understand what I've told you but... did you know? Based on your current level, you won't be able to face the Black Magician. Heck you won't be able to face off his disciple's slave's monster's pet's dummy! Are you sure you are ready to protect Maple World like that?
20001_A_LOT_OF_TIME_WILL_PASS=You may be a member of the Cygnus Knights, but that doesn't mean you're a knight. Forget being the official knight. You're not even a Knight-in-Training, yet. A lot of time will pass where you will just sit around here, doing paperwork for the Cygnus Knights, but...
20001_NO_ONE_IS_BORN_STRONG=But then again, no one is born strong, anyway. The Empress also prefers that she creates an environment where a string of powerful knights can be nurtured and created, as opposed to finding a supernaturally-gifted knight. For now, you'll have to become a Knight-in-Training, and make yourself much more powerful so you'll become useful later on. We'll talk about the duties of being a Cygnus Knight once you reach that level of competency.
20001_HEAD_TOWARDS_THE_TRAINING_FOREST=Take the portal on the left side and go straight, and you'll head towards #b Training Forest I # . There, you'll find the training instructor for the Knights, Kiku. The next time I see you, I'd like for you to be at least at level 10.
20002_NEINHEART_SENT_YOU_HERE=What? Neinheart sent you here? Ahh, you must be a rookie. Welcome, welcome. My name is Kiku, and my job is to train and mold kids like you into bonafide knights. Hmmm.. Why are you looking at me like that... Ahh, you must have never seen Piyos before.
20002_RACE_CALLED_PIYOS=We belong to a race called Piyos. You've talked to Shinsoo before, right? The one that stands next to the Empress. Yeah, Shinsoo is a Piyo, too. He may be of a different class, but... oh well. Piyos are only found in Ereve, so you may find us a bit odd at first, but you'll get used to us.
20002_NO_MONSTERS_IN_EREVE=Ah, I don't know if you are aware of this, but you won't find any monsters here in Ereve. Any form of evil will not be able to set foot on this island. Don't worry, you'll still have your opportunity to train here. Shinsoo created a fantasy creature called Mimi, which will be used as your training partners. Shall we begin?
20002_PREPARE_YOURSELF=Ha, I like your enthusiasm, but you must prepare yourself for the training first before we start things off. Make sure that you are equipped with weapons, and that your skills are calibrated and ready to be used. I also gave you some potions, so have it ready just in case. Let me know when you're ready. You're going to wish that you didn't sign up to become a Cygnus Knight.
20008_ARE_YOU_READY=Are you ready to take on a mission? If you can't pass this test, then you won't be able to call yourself a real Knight. Are you sure you can do this? If you are afraid to do this, let me know. I won't tell Neinheart. \r\n #L0#I'll try this later.#l \r\n #L1#I'm not afraid. Let's do this.#l
20008_SHOW_EVERYONE_COURAGE=If you call yourself a Knight, then do not hesitate. Show everyone how much courage you have in you.
20008_GLAD_YOU_DID_NOT_RUN_AWAY=I'm glad you didn't run away, but... are you sure you want to become a Knight-in-Training? What I am asking is whether you're okay with being a Cygnus Knight, and therefore being tied to the Empress at all times? She may be an Empress, but she's also still just a kid. Are you sure you can fight for her? I won't let Neinheart know so just tell me what you really feel. \r\n #L2#If the Empress wants peace in the Maple World, then I'm down for whatever.#l \r\n #L3#As long as I can become a knight I'll endure whatever #l
2001_THIS_IS_THE_DEED=THIS is the deed to the land that my son lost! And you even brought all the necessary materials to build the house! Thank you so much ... my relatives can all move in and live in #m102000000#! As a sign of appreciation ...
20010_WHOA_WHOA=Whoa, whoa! Are you really declining my offer? Well, you'll be able to #blevel-up quicker #kwith our help, so let me know if you change your mind. Even if you've declined a Quest, you can receive the Quest again if you just come and talk to me.
20010_WELCOME_TO_EREVE=Welcome to Ereve! And you are? Oh, you're #b#h ##k! \r\nGood to meet you. I've been waiting. You've come to become a Cygnus Knight, right? My name is Kimu, and I'm currently guiding Noblesses like you at the request of Empress Cygnus.
20010_FIRST_MEET_THE_EMPRESS=If you want to officially become a part of Cygnus Knights, you must first meet the Empress. She's at the center of this island, accompanied by Shinsoo. My brothers and I would like to share with you a few things that are considered #bBasic Knowledge#k in Maple World before you go. Would that be okay?
20010_LET_ME_WARN_YOU=Oh, let me warn you that this is a Quest. You may have noticed that NPCs around Maple World occasionally ask you for various favors. A favor of that sort is called a #bQuest#k. You will receive reward items or EXP upon completing Quests, so I strongly suggest you diligently fulfill the favors of Maple NPCs.
20010_WOULD_YOU_LIKE_TO_MEET_KIZAN=Would you like to meet #bKizan#k, who can tell you about hunting? You can find Kizan by following the arrow to the left.
20010_NICE_TO_MEET_YOU=Are you the Noblesse my brother Kimu sent? Nice to meet you! I'm Kizan. I'll give you the reward Kimu asked me to give you. Remember, you can check your Inventory by pressing the #bI key#k. Red potions help you recover HP, and blue ones help recover MP. It's a good idea to learn how to use them beforehand so you'll be ready with them when you're in danger. \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/Quest/reward# \r\n\r\n#v2000020# #z2000020# \r\n#v2000021# #z2000021# \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0#15 exp
20011_YOU_DO_NOT_WANT_TO=You don't want to? It's not even that hard, and you'll receive special equipment as a reward! Well, give it some thought and let me know if you change your mind.
20011_NUMBER_OF_WAYS_TO_HUNT=There are a number of ways to hunt, but the most basic way is with your #bRegular Attack#k. All you need is a weapon in your hand, since it's a simple matter of just swinging your weapon at monsters.
20011_REGULAR_ATTACK=Press the #bC#k to use your Regular Attack. Usually the C is located #bat the bottom left of the keyboard#k, but you don't need me to tell you that, right? Find the C and try it out!
20011_GO_TEST_IT_OUT=Now that you've tried it, we've got to test it out. In this area, you can find the weakest #r#o100120##ks in Ereve, which is perfect for you. Try hunting #r1#k. I'll give you a reward when you get back.
20011_PRETTY_SIMPLE=Ah, it seems like you've successfully hunted a #o100120#. Pretty simple, right? Regular Attacks may be easy to use, but they are pretty weak. Don't worry, though. #p1102006# will teach you how to use more powerful skills. Wait, let me give you a well-deserved quest reward before you go.
20011_NOBLESSE_EQUIPMENT=This equipment is for Noblesses. It's much cooler than what you're wearing right now, isn't it? Follow the arrows to your left to meet my younger brother #b#p1102006##k. How about you change into your new Noblesse outfit before you go? \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/4/0# \r\n#i1002869# #t1002869# - 1 \r\n#i1052177# #t1052177# - 1 \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 30 exp
20012_REGULAR_ATTACK=Regular Attacks are basic skills that are easy to use. It is important to remember that real hunting is done using your Skills. I suggest you reconsider.
20012_I_HAVE_BEEN_WAITING_FOR_YOU=I've been waiting for you, #h0#. My name is #p1102006# and I'm the third brother you are going to meet. So, you've learned about using Regular Attacks, correct? Well, next you'll be learning about your #bSkills#k, which you will find very helpful in Maple World.
20012_EARN_SP=You earn Skill Points every time you level up, which means you probably have a few saved up already. Press the #bK key#k to see your skills. Invest your Skill Points in the skill you wish to strengthen and don't forget to #bplace the skill in a Quick Slot for easy use#k.
20012_TIME_TO_PRACTICE=Time to practice before you forget. You will find a lot of #o100121#s in this area. Why don't you hunt #r3 #o100121#s#k using your #bThree Snails#b skill and bring me 1 #b#t4000483##k as proof? I'll wait for you here.
20012_VERY_IMPRESSIVE=You've successfully defeated the #o100121#s and brought me a #t4000483#. That's very impressive! #bYou earn 3 Skill Points every time you level up, after you officially become a knight, that is. Keep following the arrow to the left, and you'll meet #b#p1102007##k, who will guide you through the next step.\r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/4/0# \r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 40 exp
20013_TOO_MUCH_TO_ASK=Hmm, was that too much to ask? Is it because you don't know how to break Boxes? I'll tell you how if you accept my Quest. Let me know if you change your mind.
20013_CLANG_CLANG=#b(*clang clang*)#k
20013_WHOA=Whoa! Hey! You scared me. I didn't know I had a visitor. You must be the Noblesse #p1102006# was talking about. Welcome! I'm #p1102007#, and my hobby is making #bChairs#k. I'm thinking about making you one as a welcome present.
20013_BUT_WAIT=But wait, I can't make you one because I don't have enough materials. Could you find me the materials I need? Around this area, you will find a lot of Boxes with items inside. Could you bring me back a #t4032267# and a #t4032268# found inside those Boxes?
20013_DO_YOU_KNOW_HOW=Do you know how to get items from boxes? All you have to do is break the Boxes like you're attacking a monster. The difference is that you can attack monsters using your Skills, but you can #bonly use Regular Attacks to break Boxes#k.
20013_PLEASE_BRING_ME=Please bring me 1 #b#t4032267##k and 1 #b#t4032268##k found inside those Boxes. I'll make you an awesome Chair as soon as I have what I need. I'll wait here!
20013_JUST_WHAT_I_NEED=Did you bring me a Building Stone and a Drape? Let's see. Ah, these are just what I need! They indeed are a #t4032267# and a #t4032268#! I'll make you a Chair right away.
20013_HERE_IT_IS=Here it is, a #t3010060#. What do you think? Nifty, huh? You can #bquickly recover your HP by sitting in this Chair#k. It will be stored in the #bSet-up#k window in your Inventory, so confirm that you've received the chair and head over to #b#p1102008##k. You'll see him if you keep following the arrow to the left. \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/4/0# \r\n#i3010060# 1 #t3010060# \r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 95 exp
20016_STILL_SOME_QUESTIONS=Oh, do you still have some questions? Talk to me again and I'll explain it to you from the very beginning.
20016_HELLO=Hello, #h0#. Welcome to #p1101000# Knights. My name is #p1101002# and I am currently serving as the young Empress's Tactician. We'd better get acquainted since we'll be seeing a lot of each other. Haha!
20016_I_WILL_EXPLAIN_IT_ALL=I'm sure you have a lot of questions since everything happened so quickly. I'll explain it all, one by one, from where you are to what you're here to do.
20016_ISLAND_CALLED_EREVE=This island is called Ereve. Thanks to the Empress's magic, this island usually floats around like a boat in the sky and patrols around Maple World. Right now, however, we've stopped here for a reason.
20016_YOUNG_EMPRESS=The young Empress is the ruler of Maple World. What? This is the first time you've heard of her? Ah, yes. Well, she's the ruler of Maple World but she doesn't like to control it. She watches from afar to make sure that all is well. Well, at least that's her usual role.
20016_FINDING_SIGNS=But that's not the case right now. We've been finding signs all over Maple World that foreshadow the revival of the Black Magician. We can't have the Black Mage come back to terrorize Maple World as he has in the past!
20016_BECOME_SPOILED=But that was ages ago and people today don't realize how scary the Black Magician is. We've all become spoiled by the peaceful Maple World we enjoy today and forgotten how chaotic and frightening Maple World once was. If we don't do something, the Black Mage will once again rule Maple World!
20016_KNIGHTHOOD=This is why the young Empress has decided to take matters into her own hands. She's forming a knighthood of brave Maplers to defeat the Black Magician once and for all. You know what you need to do, right? I'm sure you have an idea since you, yourself, signed up to be a Knight.
20016_HAVE_TO_GET_STRONGER=We have to get stronger so we can defeat the Black Magician if he revives. Our primary goal is to prevent him from destroying Maple World, and you will play a prominent role in that.
20016_CONCLUSION=That concludes my explanation. Have I answered all your questions? \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/4/0# \r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 380 exp
20016_I_AM_GLAD=I'm glad you're clear about our current situation, but you know, at your current level, you're not even strong enough to face the Black Magician's minions, let alone the Black Mage himself. Not even his minions' minions, as a matter of fact. How will you protect Maple World at your current level?
20016_CANNOT_BE_RECOGNIZED_AS_A_KNIGHT=Although you've been accepted into the knighthood, you cannot be recognized as a knight yet. You are not an Official Knight because you're not even a Knight-in-Training. If you remain at your current level, you'll be nothing more than the handyman of #p1101000# Knights.
20016_WANTED_SOMEONE_WITH_COURAGE=But no one starts as a strong Knight on day one. The Empress didn't want someone strong. She wanted someone with courage whom she could develop into a strong Knight through rigorous training. So, you should first become a Knight-in-Training. We'll talk about your missions when you get to that point.
20016_BECOME_STRONGER=Take the portal on the left to reach the Training Forest. There, you will find #p1102000#, the Training Instructor, who will teach you how to become stronger. I don't want to find you wandering around aimlessly until you reach Lv. 10, you hear?
20017_NOTHING_TO_WORRY_ABOUT=Hmm, there is nothing to worry about. This will be a breeze for someone your level. Muster your courage and let me know when you're ready.
20017_WELCOME=Hmm? #p1101002# sent you, huh? You must be the newbie that recently joined Cygnus Knights. Welcome, and nice to meet you! My name is #p1102000#. I'm the Training Instructor who trains all Noblesses like yourself. Of course, I'm not a human as you can tell.
20017_CALLED_PIYOS=We are called Piyos. You've seen #p1101001# who is at the Empress's side all the time, haven't you? Piyos are of the same family as #p1101001#, but we belong to different types. Of course, you haven't seen any of us since we only live in Ereve. You'll get used to Piyos in no time.
20017_NO_MONSTERS_IN_EREVE=Oh, and did you know that there are no monsters in Ereve? Not even a smidgen of evil dare enter Ereve. But don't you worry. You'll be able to train with illusory monsters created by #p1101001# called Mimis.
20017_SEEM_PREPARED=You seem prepared! Looking at what you've accomplished, I think you should jump right into hunting more advanced Mimis. How about you hunt #b15 #r#o100122#s in #m130010100##k#k? Use the portal on the left to reach the #bTraining Forest II#k.
20020_DECIDE_WHAT_YOU_REALLY_WANT_TO_DO=Talk to me after you have decided what you really want to do. Whatever you choose, you will not miss out or lose privileges, so don't take this too seriously...
20020_YOU_HAVE_WORKED_HARD=I can tell you've worked really hard by seeing that you're already at Level 10. I think it's time now for you to break out as a Noblesse and officially become the Knight-in-Training. Before doing that, however, I want to ask you one thing. Have you decided which Knight you'd want to become?
20020_FIVE_PATHS=There isn't a single path to becoming a Knight. In fact, there are five of them laid out for you. It's up to you to choose which path you'd like to take, but it should definitely be something you will not regret. That's why... I am offering to show you what you'll look like once you become a Knight.
20020_WHAT_DO_YOU_THINK=What do you think? Are you interested in seeing yourself as the leader of the Knights? If you have already decided what kind of Knight you'd like to become, then you won't necessarily have to look at it...\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Show me how I'd look like as the leader of the Knights.#l ..#b#L1#No, I'm okay.
20020_SEE_IT_FOR_YOURSELF=Would you like to see for it yourself right now? A short clip will come out soon. Be prepared for what you are about to witness.
2003_ASK_ME_ANY_QUESTIONS=Now...ask me any questions you may have on traveling!!\r\n#L0##bHow do I move?#l\r\n#L1#How do I take down the monsters?#l\r\n#L2#How can I pick up an item?#l\r\n#L3#What happens when I die?#l\r\n#L4#When can I choose a job?#l\r\n#L5#Tell me more about this island!#l\r\n#L6#What should I do to become a Warrior?#l\r\n#L7#What should I do to become a Bowman?#l\r\n#L8#What should I do to become a Magician?#l\r\n#L9#What should I do to become a Thief?#l\r\n#L10#How do I raise the character stats? (S)#l\r\n#L11#How do I check the items that I just picked up?#l\r\n#L12#How do I put on an item?#l\r\n#L13#How do I check out the items that I'm wearing?#l\r\n#L14#What are skills? (K)#l\r\n#L15#How do I get to Victoria Island?#l\r\n#L16#What are mesos?#l#k
2003_HOW_TO_MOVE=Alright this is how you move. Use #bleft, right arrow#k to move around the flatland and slanted roads, and press #bAlt#k to jump. A select number of shoes improve your speed and jumping abilities.
2003_HOW_TO_TAKE_DOWN_A_MONSTER=Here's how to take down a monster. Every monster possesses an HP of its own and you'll take them down by attacking with either a weapon or through spells. Of course the stronger they are, the harder it is to take them down.
2003_HOW_TO_GATHER=This is how you gather up an item. Once you take down a monster, an item will be dropped to the ground. When that happens, stand in front of the item and press #bZ#k or #b0 on the NumPad#k to acquire the item.
2003_WHEN_YOU_DIE=Curious to find out what happens when you die? You'll become a ghost when your HP reaches 0. There will be a tombstone in that place and you won't be able to move, although you still will be able to chat.
2003_CHOOSING_A_JOB=When do you get to choose your job? Hahaha, take it easy, my friend. Each job has a requirement set for you to meet. Normally a level between 8 and 10 will do, so work hard.
2003_THE_ISLAND=Want to know about this island? It's called Maple Island and it floats in the air. It's been floating in the sky for a while so the nasty monsters aren't really around. It's a very peaceful island, perfect for beginners!
2003_WARRIOR_TO_DO=You want to become a #bWarrior#k? Hmmm, then I suggest you head over to Victoria Island. Head over to a warrior-town called #rPerion#k and see #bDances with Balrog#k.

2003_BOWMAN_TO_DO=You want to become a #bBowman#k? You'll need to go to Victoria Island to make the job advancement.

2003_MAGICIAN_TO_DO=You want to become a #bMagician#k? For you to do that, you'll have to head over to Victoria Island.

2003_THIEF_TO_DO=You want to become a #bThief#k? In order to become one, you'll have to head over to Victoria Island.

Ohh, and one VERY important thing: You'll need to be at least level 10 in order to become a thief!!
2003_RAISE_STATS=You want to know how to raise your character's ability stats? First press #bS#k to check out the ability window. Every time you level up, you'll be awarded 5 ability points aka AP's. Assign those AP's to the ability of your choice. It's that simple.
2003_CHECK_ITEMS=You want to know how to check out the items you've picked up, huh? When you defeat a monster, it'll drop an item on the ground, and you may press #bZ#k to pick up the item. That item will then be stored in your item inventory, and you can take a look at it by simply pressing #bI#k.
2003_WEAR_ITEMS=You want to know how to wear the items, right? Press #bI#k to check out your item inventory. Place your mouse cursor on top of an item and double-click on it to put it on your character. If you find yourself unable to wear the item, chances are your character does not meet the level & stat requirements. You can also put on the item by opening the equipment inventory (#bE#k) and dragging the item into it. To take off an item, double-click on the item at the equipment inventory.
2003_CHECK_EQUIPMENT=You want to check on the equipped items, right? Press #bE#k to open the equipment inventory, where you'll see exactly what you are wearing right at the moment. To take off an item, double-click on the item. The item will then be sent to the item inventory.
2003_SPECIAL_ABILITIES=The special 'abilities' you get after acquiring a job are called skills. You'll acquire skills that are specifically for that job. You're not at that stage yet, so you don't have any skills yet, but just remember that to check on your skills, press #bK#k to open the skill book. It'll help you down the road.
2003_GET_TO_VICTORIA=How do you get to Victoria Island? On the east of this island there's a harbor called Southperry. There, you'll find a ship that flies in the air. In front of the ship stands the captain. Ask him about it.
2003_MESO=It's the currency used in MapleStory. You may purchase items through mesos. To earn them, you may either defeat the monsters, sell items at the store, or complete quests...
2003_ATTACKING_MONSTERS=In order to attack the monsters, you'll need to be equipped with a weapon. When equipped, press #bCtrl#k to use the weapon. With the right timing, you'll be able to easily take down the monsters.
2003_JOB_ADVANCEMENT=Once you make the job advancement, you'll acquire different kinds of skills, and you can assign them to HotKeys for easier access. If it's an attacking skill, you don't need to press Ctrl to attack, just press the button assigned as a HotKey.
2003_FULL_INVENTORY=Remember, though, that if your item inventory is full, you won't be able to acquire more. So if you have an item you don't need, sell it so you can make something out of it. The inventory may expand once you make the job advancement.
2003_BEGINNER_DEATH=There isn't much to lose when you die if you are just a beginner. Once you have a job, however, it's a different story. You'll lose a portion of your EXP when you die, so make sure you avoid danger and death at all cost.
2003_HOW_TO_ADVANCE=Level isn't the only thing that determines the advancement, though. You also need to boost up the levels of a particular ability based on the occupation. For example, to be a warrior, your STR has to be over 35, and so forth, you know what I'm saying? Make sure you boost up the abilities that has direct implications to your job.
2003_POWERFUL_PLAYER=But, if you want to be a powerful player, better not think about staying here for too long. You won't be able to get a job anyway. Underneath this island lies an enormous island called Victoria Island. That place is so much bigger than here, it's not even funny.
2003_MAGICIAN_SPECIAL=Oh by the way, unlike other jobs, to become a magician you only need to be at level 8. What comes with making the job advancement early also comes with the fact that it takes a lot to become a true powerful magician. Think long and carefully before choosing your path.
2003_ABILITY_EXPLANATION=Place your mouse cursor on top of all abilities for a brief explanation. For example, STR for warriors, DEX for bowman, INT for magician, and LUK for thief. That itself isn't everything you need to know, so you'll need to think long and hard on how to emphasize your character's strengths through assigning the points.
2003_ONE_LAST_PIECE=Oh yeah! One last piece of information before I go. If you are not sure where you are, always press #bW#k. The world map will pop up with the locator showing where you stand. You won't have to worry about getting lost with that.

2040022_STIMULATOR_INFO=A stimulator is a special potion that I can add into the process of creating certain items. It gives it stats as though it had dropped from a monster.

There's also a 10% chance of not getting any item when using a stimulator, so please choose wisely.

2040030_COMMAND=Depending on the command you give, pets can love it, hate, and display other kinds of reactions to it. If you give the pet a command and it follows you well, your closeness goes up. Double click on the pet and you can check the closeness, level, fullness and etc...

2040030_SPECIAL_COMMANDS=Oh yeah, they'll react when you give them special commands. You can scold them, love them.. it all depends on how you take care of them. They are afraid to leave their masters so be nice to them, show them love. They can get sad and lonely fast..
2040030_TALK_TO_THE_PET=Talk to the pet, pay attention to it and its closeness level will go up and eventually his overall level will go up too. As the closeness rises, the pet's overall level will rise soon after. As the overall level rises, one day the pet may even talk like a person a little bit, so try hard raising it. Of course it won't be easy doing so...
2040030_GETS_HUNGRY=It may be a live doll but they also have life so they can feel the hunger too. #bFullness#k shows the level of hunger the pet's in. 100 is the max, and the lower it gets, it means that the pet is getting hungrier. After a while, it won't even follow your command and be on the offensive, so watch out over that.
2040030_CANNOT_EAT_NORMAL_FOOD=That's right! Pets can't eat the normal human food. Instead a teddy bear in Ludibrium called #bPatricia#k sells #bPet Food#k so if you need food for your pet, find #bPatricia#k It'll be a good idea to buy the food in advance and feed the pet before it gets really hungry.
2040030_GOES_BACK_HOME=Oh, and if you don't feed the pet for a long period of time, it goes back home by itself. You can take it out of its home and feed it but it's not really good for the pet's health, so try feeding him on a regular basis so it doesn't go down to that level, alright? I think this will do.
2040030_AFTER_SOME_TIME=After some time... that's correct, they stop moving. They just turn back to being a doll, after the effect of magic dies down and Water of Life dries out. But that doesn't mean it's stopped forever, because once you pour Water of Life over, it's going to be back alive.
2040030_SAD_TO_SEE_THEM_STOP=Even if it someday moves again, it's sad to see them stop altogether. Please be nice to them while they are alive and moving. Feed them well, too. Isn't it nice to know that there's something alive that follows and listens to only you?
2040031_ROLL_ON_THE_GROUND=A document roll on the ground.
2040032_WALK_WITH_YOUR_PET=This is the road where you can go take a walk with your pet. You can walk around with it, or you can train your pet to go through obstacles here. If you aren't too close with your pet yet, that may present a problem and he will not follow your command as much... So, what do you think? Wanna train your pet?
2040032_TOO_BUSY=Hmmm ... too busy to do it right now? If you feel like doing it, though, come back and find me.
2040032_GET_THE_LETTER=Get that letter, jump over obstacles with your pet, and take that letter to my brother Trainer Frod. Give him the letter and something good is going to happen to your pet.
2040032_HERE_IS_THE_LETTER=Ok, here's the letter. He wouldn't know I sent you if you just went there straight, so go through the obstacles with your pet, go to the very top, and then talk to Trainer Frod to give him the letter. It won't be hard if you pay attention to your pet while going through obstacles. Good luck!
2040033_BROTHERS_LETTER=Eh, that's my brother's letter! Probably scolding me for thinking I'm not working and stuff...Eh? Ahhh...you followed my brother's advice and trained your pet and got up here, huh? Nice!! Since you worked hard to get here, I'll boost your intimacy level with your pet.
2040033_CHILL_FOR_A_FEW=My brother told me to take care of the pet obstacle course, but ... since I'm so far away from him, I can't help but wanting to goof around ...hehe, since I don't see him in sight, might as well just chill for a few minutes.
2040033_GET_OUTTA_HERE=Hmmm ... did you really get here with your pet? These obstacles are for pets. What are you here for without it?? Get outta here!
2040033_TRAIN_YOUR_PET_AGAIN=What do you think? Don't you think you have gotten much closer with your pet? If you have time, train your pet again on this obstacle course...of course, with my brother's permission.
2040034_PQ_ENCOUNTERED_ERROR=The Ludibrium PQ has encountered an error.

2042000_HELLO=Haha! I am Spiegelmann, the leader of this Monster Carnival. I got the first #bMonster Carnival#k here, waiting for travelers like you to take part in this extravaganza!
2042000_MONSTER_CARNIVAL_INFO=#bMonster Carnival#k consists of 2 groups entering the battlefield, and dropping the monsters invoked by the other party. #bA combat brigade that determines the victor by the amount of Carnival Points (CP) received#k.
2042000_EASY_RIGHT=When you enter the Carnival Field, you will see the Monster List window appear. All you need to do is #bselect what you want to use, and press OK#k. Very easy, right?
2042000_WHAT_IS_IT=What is #bMonster Carnival#k? Hahaha! Let's say it's an experience you'll never forget! It's a battle against other travelers just like you!#k
2042000_HOW_TO=When entering the Carnival Field, your task is to #breceive CP by killing the monsters from the opposite group, and using these CP's to distract the opposing group from hitting monsters#k.
2042000_COMMANDS=Once you get used to the commands, try using #bTAB and F1 ~ F12#k. #bTAB toggles between Monster Invocation / Skills / Protector#k, and, #bF1 ~ F12 enables you to access one of the windows directly#k.
2042000_I_KNOW_IT_IS_TOO_DANGEROUS=I know it's too dangerous for you to fight with each other using real weapons; and I would not suggest such a barbaric act. Not my friend, what I offer to the competition. The excitement of the battle and the excitement of competing against such strong and motivated people. I offer the premise that your group and the opposite group both #binvoquem the monsters, and defeat the monsters invoked by the opposing group. This is the essence of the Monster Carnival. In addition, you can use Maple Coins earned during the Monster Carnival to get new items and weapons! #k
2042000_3_WAYS_TO_DISTRACT=There are 3 ways to distract the opposing group: #bSummoning a monster, Ability, and Protector#k. I will give you a more in-depth look if you want to know more about 'detailed instructions'!
2042000_SUMMONING=#bSummoning#k a Monster calls a monster that attacks the opposing party, under its control. Use CP to bring an Summoned Monster, and it will appear in the same area, attacking the opposing group.
2042000_OF_COURSE=Of course, it's not that simple. There are other ways to prevent the other group from dropping monsters, and it's up to you to figure out how to do it. What do you think? Interested in a friendly competition?
2042000_PLEASE_REMEMBER=Please remember. It's never a good idea to keep your CP's. #bThe CPs you used will help determine the winner and loser of Monster Carnival.
2042000_ABILITY=#bAbility#k is an option to use abilities such as Darkness, Weakness, and others to prevent the opposing group from killing other monsters. Not many CPs are needed, but it's worth it. The only problem is they do not last very long. Use this tactic wisely!
2042000_DO_NOT_LOSE_EXP_WHEN_DEAD=Oh, and do not worry about turning into a ghost. In the Monster Carnival, #byou will not lose EXP after death#k. So it's really an experience like no other!
2042000_PROTECTOR=#bProtector#k basically an invoked item that drastically increases the abilities of the monsters invoked by your group. Protector works until it is demolished by the opposing group, so I'm hoping you'll summon several monsters first, and then bring the Protector.
2042000_CANNOT_USE_ITEMS=Lastly, while in the Monster Carnival, #byou can not use items / recovery potions that you carry around with you. #kMeanwhile, the monsters let these items fall for good. when, and when you #bget them, the item will immediately activate#k. That's why it's important to know when to get these items.
2042000_DONE=Done. Thanks for showing up~.
2042000_DONE_BUT_LACK_ETC_SPACE=Done. Be aware some of the items #rcould not be synthesized#k because either you have a lack of space on your ETC inventory or there's not enough mesos to cover the fee.

2042002_HELLO=Haha! I am Spiegelmann, the leader of this Monster Carnival. I got the first #bMonster Carnival#k here, waiting for travelers like you to take part in this extravaganza!
2042002_MONSTER_CARNIVAL_INFO=#bMonster Carnival#k consists of 2 groups entering the battlefield, and dropping the monsters invoked by the other party. #bA combat brigade that determines the victor by the amount of Carnival Points (CP) received#k.
2042002_EASY_RIGHT=When you enter the Carnival Field, you will see the Monster List window appear. All you need to do is #bselect what you want to use, and press OK#k. Very easy, right?
2042002_WHAT_IS_IT=What is #bMonster Carnival#k? Hahaha! Let's say it's an experience you'll never forget! It's a battle against other travelers just like you!#k
2042002_HOW_TO=When entering the Carnival Field, your task is to #breceive CP by killing the monsters from the opposite group, and using these CP's to distract the opposing group from hitting monsters#k.
2042002_COMMANDS=Once you get used to the commands, try using #bTAB and F1 ~ F12#k. #bTAB toggles between Monster Invocation / Skills / Protector#k, and, #bF1 ~ F12 enables you to access one of the windows directly#k.
2042002_I_KNOW_IT_IS_TOO_DANGEROUS=I know it's too dangerous for you to fight with each other using real weapons; and I would not suggest such a barbaric act. Not my friend, what I offer to the competition. The excitement of the battle and the excitement of competing against such strong and motivated people. I offer the premise that your group and the opposite group both #binvoquem the monsters, and defeat the monsters invoked by the opposing group. This is the essence of the Monster Carnival. In addition, you can use Maple Coins earned during the Monster Carnival to get new items and weapons! #k
2042002_3_WAYS_TO_DISTRACT=There are 3 ways to distract the opposing group: #bSummoning a monster, Ability, and Protector#k. I will give you a more in-depth look if you want to know more about 'detailed instructions'!
2042002_SUMMONING=#bSummoning#k a Monster calls a monster that attacks the opposing party, under its control. Use CP to bring an Summoned Monster, and it will appear in the same area, attacking the opposing group.
2042002_OF_COURSE=Of course, it's not that simple. There are other ways to prevent the other group from dropping monsters, and it's up to you to figure out how to do it. What do you think? Interested in a friendly competition?
2042002_PLEASE_REMEMBER=Please remember. It's never a good idea to keep your CP's. #bThe CPs you used will help determine the winner and loser of Monster Carnival.
2042002_ABILITY=#bAbility#k is an option to use abilities such as Darkness, Weakness, and others to prevent the opposing group from killing other monsters. Not many CPs are needed, but it's worth it. The only problem is they do not last very long. Use this tactic wisely!
2042002_DO_NOT_LOSE_EXP_WHEN_DEAD=Oh, and do not worry about turning into a ghost. In the Monster Carnival, #byou will not lose EXP after death#k. So it's really an experience like no other!
2042002_PROTECTOR=#bProtetor#k basically an invoked item that drastically increases the abilities of the monsters invoked by your group. Protector works until it is demolished by the opposing group, so I'm hoping you'll summon several monsters first, and then bring the Protector.
2042002_CANNOT_USE_ITEMS=Lastly, while in the Monster Carnival, #byou can not use items / recovery potions that you carry around with you. #kMeanwhile, the monsters let these items fall for good. when, and when you #bget them, the item will immediately activate#k. That's why it's important to know when to get these items.
2042002_DONE=Done. Thanks for showing up~.
2042002_DONE_BUT_LACK_ETC_SPACE=Done. Be aware some of the items #rcould not be synthesized#k because either you have a lack of space on your ETC inventory or there's not enough mesos to cover the fee.

You have to be teached once again: The riding for Knights are a bit different from the rides available for regular folks. The takes place through a creature that is of the Mimi race that can be found on this island; they are called #bMimianas#k. Instead of riding monsters, the Knights ride Mimiana. There's one thing that you should never, ever forget.
20526_CAN_BE_YOUR_FRIEND=Dont't think of this as just a form of mount or transportation. These mounts can be your friend, your comrade, your colleague... all of the above. Even a friend close enough to entrust your life! That's why the Knights of Ereve actually grow their own mounts.

20527_TRAIN_A_BIT_MORE=It looks like your Mimiana haven't reached #rlevel 3#k yet. Please train it a bit more before trying to advance it.
20600_YOU_BEEN_SLACKING_OFF=#h0#. Have you been slacking off on training since reaching Level 100? We all know how powerful you are, but the training is not complete.

20700_FINALLY_A_KNIGHT_IN_TRAINING=You have finally become a Knight-in-Training. I'd like to give you a mission right away, but you still look miles away from even being able to handle a task on your own. Are you sure you can even go to Victoria Island like this?
20700_HARM_REPUTATION=It's up to you to head over to Victoria Island, but a Knight-in-Training that can't take care of one's self in battles is likely to cause harm to the Empress's impeccable reputation.

20720_HOWS_THE_LEVELING=How's the leveling up so far? By this time, you might be able to participate in the Party Quest at #m103000000#. Leveling up is important, yes, but we need you now to take on a mission as a Cygnus Knight. We just received a new information that may help us.

21012_WELCOME=Welcome, hero! What's that? You want to know how I knew who you were? That's easy. I eavesdropped on some people talking loudly next to me. I'm sure the rumor has spread through the entire island already. Everyone knows that you've returned!

21013_YOU_DO_NOT_WANT_THE_POTION=What? You don't want the potion?
21013_GIVE_ME_A_FEW_SECONDS=Ah, you've brought all the components. Give me a few seconds to assemble them.. Like this.. And like that.. and...\r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/4/0#\r\n#v3010062# 1 #t3010062#\r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 95 exp
21015_I_HAVE_DONE_ENOUGH_EXPLAINING=Alright, I've done enough explaining for now. Let's move on to the next stage. What's the next stage, you ask? I just told you. Train as hard as you can until you become strong enough to defeat the Black Magician with a single blow.
21015_YOU_MAY_HAVE_BEEN=You may have been a hero in the past, but that was hundreds of years ago. Even if it weren't for the curse of the Black Magician, all those years you spent frozen in time have stiffened your body. You must loosen up a bit and slowly regain your agility. How do you do that, you ask?
21015_FIRST_MASTER_THE_FUNDAMENTALS=Don't you know that you must first master the fundamentals? So the wise thing to do is to begin with #bBasic Training#k. Oh, of course, I forgot that you lost your memory. Well, that's why I'm here. You'll just have to experience it yourself. Shall we begin?

21017_DO_NOT_BE_SO_MODEST=You don't have to be so modest. I understand your desire to quickly become the hero you once were. This sort of attitude is what makes you a hero.
21018_UNDERGO_A_TEST=Now, you will undergo a test that will determine whether you're fit or not. All you have to do is take on the most powerful monster on this island, #o0100134#s. About #r50#k of them would suffice, but...
21018_HOW_ABOUT_5=We can't have you wipe out the entire population of #o0100134#s, since they aren't many of them out there. How about 5 of them? You're here to train, not to destroy the ecosystem.
21018_5_IS_NOT_ENOUGH=Oh, is 5 not enough? If you feel the need to train further, please feel free to slay more than that. If you slay all of them, I'll just have to look the other way even if it breaks my heart, since they will have been sacrificed for a good cause...
21018_CONTINUE_GOING_LEFT=#o0100134#s can be found in deeper parts of the island. Continue going left until you reach #b#m140010200##k, and defeat #r5 #o0100134#s#k.
2102000_NOT_A_SHORT_FLIGHT=This will not be a short flight, so you need to take care of some things, I suggest you do that first before getting on board. Do you still wish to board the genie?

2102000_IF_YOU_CHANGE_YOUR_MIND=Okay, talk to me if you change your mind!
2102000_HAVE_TO_GO_ON_THE_NEXT_RIDE=This genie is getting ready for takeoff. I'm sorry, but you'll have to get on the next ride. The ride schedule is available through the guide at the ticketing booth.
2102001_WISH_TO_LEAVE_THE_GENIE=Do you wish to leave the genie?
2102001_SEE_YOU_NEXT_TIME=Alright, see you next time. Take care.
2102002_MUST_HAVE_SOME_OTHER_BUSINESS=You must have some business to take care of here, right?
2102002_HELLO=Hello, I'm in charge of selling tickets for the ship ride to Orbis Station of Ossyria. The ride to Orbis takes off every 10 minutes, beginning on the hour, and it'll cost you #b{0} mesos#k. Are you sure you want to purchase #b#t4031045##k?
2102002_NOT_ENOUGH_MESOS=Are you sure you have #b{0} mesos#k? If so, then I urge you to check your etc. inventory, and see if it's full or not.

2103013_YOU_FOOLS=You fools who know no fear of Nett's wrath, it is now time to choose your destiny! \r\n\r\n#b#L0# Enter alone.#l\r\n#L1# Enter with a party of 2 or more.#l

2103013_ONCE_YOU_ENTER=Once you enter the Pyramid, you will be faced with the wrath of Nett. Since you don't look too sharp, I will offer you some advice and rules to follow. Remember them well.#b\r\n\r\n1. Be careful that your #e#rAct Gauge#b#n does not decrease. The only way to maintain your Gauge level is to battle the monsters without stopping.\r\n2. Those who are unable will pay dearly. Be careful to not cause any #rMiss#b.\r\n3. Be wary of the Pharaoh Jr. Yeti with the #v04032424# mark. Make the mistake of attacking him and you will regret it.\r\n4. Be wise about using the skill that is given to you for Kill accomplishments.
2103013_YOU_WHO_LACK_FEAR=You who lack fear of death's cruelty, make your decision!\r\n#L0##i3994115##l#L1##i3994116##l#L2##i3994117##l#L3##i3994118##l
2103013_ARE_YOU_SURE_YOU_HAVE_ONE=You'll need a gem to enter Pharaoh Yeti's Tomb. Are you sure you have one?
2103013_THE_REST_IS_IN_YOUR_HANDS=Those who are able to withstand Nett's wrath will be honored, but those who fail will face destruction. This is all the advice I can give you. The rest is in your hands.

According to what's been recorded, the weapon of a hero will recognize its rightful owner, and if you're the hero that used the #p1201001#, the #p1201001# will react when you grab the #p1201001#.

2111004_PRESIDENT_HAS_BEEN_PROTECTING_US=Even though Alchemists and Fairies have antipathy for each other, I can still be in this town because the Zenumist President has been protecting us.

Magatia created these forbidding laws to protect it's people from the undoings a greater power like this would do if it reaches wrong hands. That's not the end for you, accept rehabilitation from the Societies and everything will work out!#l
2112001_ARE_YOU_GUYS_FORGIVING_ME=... Are you guys forgiving me after all that I've done? Well, I guess I was blinded by the great source of power that could be discovered that way, maybe they're right saying a human can't simply fathom on the usage of those powers without corrupting themselves along the way... I am profoundly sorry, and to make myself up with everyone I'm willing to help the Societies again wherever I can on the progress of alchemy. Thank you.

You! Yes, you. Don't you think this ends here, look back at your companions, they need some help! I'll be retreating for now.
2112010_I_HAVE_BEEN_BEATEN=Nooooo... I have been beaten? But how? Everything I did was for the sake of the development of a greater alchemy! You can't jail me, I did what everybody standing in a place like mine would do! But no, they simply decided to damp up the progress of the science JUST BECAUSE it was deemed dangerous??? Oh, come on!

Magatia created these forbidding laws to protect it's people from the undoings a greater power like this would do if it reaches wrong hands.

2112011_ARE_YOU_FORGIVING_ME=... Are you guys forgiving me after all that I've done? Well, I guess I was blinded by the great source of power that could be discovered that way, maybe they're right saying a human can't simply fathom on the usage of those powers without corrupting themselves along the way...

21201_AT_LEAST_YOU_TRIED=Hey! At least say you tried!
21201_FIRST_YOU_PROMISE=First you promise to defeat the Black Magician and make me a famous weapon, then you abandon me for hundreds of years, and now you're telling me you don't remember who I am? What the...?! Do you think I will let you get away with that? You're the one who begged and pined for me!
21201_AFTER_ALL_THAT_BEGGING=After all that begging, shouldn't you treat me with a little more love and respect? Ya know, a weapon like me's a rare and wonderful thing. I am the ultimate #p1201001# that can help you defeat the Black Magician. How could you ditch me for hundreds of years?
21201_YOU_GOT_ON_YOUR_KNEES=What? You never begged for me? Ha! #p1203000# told me you got on your knees, begged for me in tears, and... Wait a sec. Aran! Did you just remember who I am?
21201_JUST_ALLERGIES=Aran, it is you! *Sniff sniff* Wait, *ahem* I didn't get emotional, it's just allergies. I know the Black Magician has stripped you of your abilities so you probably don't even have the strength to lift me... but at least you remember me! I'm glad that your memory's starting to return.
21201_STILL_MY_MASTER=Even though you've lost your memory, you're still my master. You endured some very tough training in the past, and I'm sure your body still remembers the skills you got through those hard times. Alright, I'll restore your abilities!

21201_I_CAN_RESTORE_A_FEW=Your level isn't what it used to be back in your glory days, so I can't restore all of your old abilities. But the few I can restore should help you level up faster. Now hurry up and train so you can return to the old you.

21202_WHAT_ARE_YOU_DOING_HERE=Hmm.. What's a young person like you doing in this secluded place?

21202_TOO_OLD=I'm too old to make weapons now, but.. I do have a Polearm that I made way back when. It's still in excellent shape. But I can't give it to you because that Polearm is extremely sharp, so sharp it could hurt its master. Do you still want it?
21202_IF_YOU_SAY_SO=Well, if you say so.. I can't object to that. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a quick test, and if you pass it, the Giant Polearm is yours. Head over to the #bTraining Center#k and take on the #rScarred Bears#k that are there. Your job is to bring back #b30 Sign of Acceptances#k.
21202_IT_WILL_BE_YOURS_IN_THE_END=Hm? Are you hesitant to take it now after all that? Well, give it more thought if you'd like. It'll be yours in the end anyways.
21202_STRONG_THAN_I_THOUGHT=Oh, have you brought me the #t4032311#? You're stronger than I thought! But more importantly, I am impressed with the amount of courage you displayed when you agreed to take this dangerous weapon without any hesitation. You deserve it. The #p1201001# is yours.
21202_GO_FOR_THE_30=Go for the 30 #t4032311#.
21202_HANDED_YOU=#b(After a long time passed, #p1203000# handed you the #p1201001#, which was carefully wrapped in cloth.)

21300_BEFORE_DOING_THAT=But before doing that, I'll need you back in Rein for a bit. #bYour pole arm is reacting strange once again. It looks like it has something it wants to tell you. #kIt might be able to awaken your hidden powers, so please come immediately.
21300_ANYWAY=Anyway, I thought it was really something that a weapon has its own identity, but seriously... this weapon does not stop talking. It first kept on crying because I wasn't really paying attention to its needs, and... ahh, please keep this a secret from the pole arm. I don't think it's a good idea to upset the weapon any further.
21301_NEED_TO_THINK_ABOUT_THIS=#b(You need to think about this for a second...)#k
21301_DID_YOU_MANAGE=Did you manage to slay #o9001013#? Hahaha... you're my master, indeed. Okay, now give me the Red Jade that you found there. I'll have to put it back on the body, and... wait, why aren't you saying a word? Don't tell me... that you didn't bring that back!
21301_DID_YOU_FORGET=What?! You really didn't bring back the Red Jade? Why? Did you just completely forget it? Ahh... even with the curse of the Black Magican, and the amount of time that has passed and all, never did I think my master would turn out to be stupid...
21301_REMAIN_CALM=No, no, I can't let this put me in despair. This is when I should remain calm and in control, unlike my master...\r\noosah...
21301_START_A_NEW=Even if you go back there now, the thief probably made its way out of there. This means you'll have to make the Red Jade anew. You've made one before, so you do remember the materials required to make one, right? Now go...

21301_NOOO=...No hope, no dreams... Nooooo!!

21302_GIVE_ME_THE_JADE=Wait.. Isn't that.. Did you remember how to make Red Jade?\r\nWow... you may be stupid and prone to amnesia, but this is why I can't abandon you. Now give me the jade!
21302_WORK_MY_MAGIC=Okay, now that I have the Red Jade back on, let me work on reawakening more of your abilities. I mean, your level's gone much higher since the last time we met, so I am sure I can work my magic a bit more this time!
21302_EQUIP_INVENTORY_IS_FULL=Wow, your #bequip#k inventory is full. I need you to make at least 1 empty slot to complete this quest.

2148_CREEPY=Some bats seems to accompany this tree wherever it goes. Creepy...
2149_NEED_A_HERO=It is said that a old tree gets alive whenever something sinister disturbs this land... We need a hero that fends our village of that creature!
2150_TREE_HAS_A_SCARF=The tree has a scarf upon its branches, I tell you.
2151_STRANGE_CARVING=The tree has a strange carving that resembles a scary face.
2152_IF_I_RECALL_CORRECTLY=That tree... I've heard of it before, I even studied its behavior! If I recall correctly, the #bStumpy#k comes alive when the soil deems infertile by some sort of magic, and those stumps who evolves under these conditions starts to drain these suspicious magical sources instead of water and minerals for living, which makes them very threatening to people and villages nearby.
21600_IF_YOU_ASK_ME=Hey, Aran. You seem pretty strong, since that time from when you got freed from the glacier. Suitable enough to #bride a wolf#k, if you ask me.
21600_FIRST_MAKE_YOUR_WAY=Picked your interest, huh? Very well, first you must make your way to #bAqua#k, there is a person there who makes #rfood for wolf cubs#k. Bring one portion to me, and I shall deem you able to tame and take care of one. What do you say, will you try for it?
21600_THE_ONE_YOU_MUST_MEET=Alright. The one you must meet is #bNanuke#k, she is on top of a #rsnowy whale#k, somewhere in the ocean. Good luck!
21604_I_WILL_TEACH_YOU=You want to use a Wolf as a mount, but you don't have a #bWolf saddle#k? Why, I have just the fine solution for you! Come here in #bEl Nath#k first, I shall teach you how to mount a wolf as an extra.

21613_TEST_TO_SEE_IF_YOU_ARE_WORTHY=We understand, but we won't leave without our pup. Tell you what, we'll test you to see if you are worthy of raising a wolf. #rGet ready to be tested by wolves.#k

21618_STEP_ASIDE=Step aside, behold the mighty prowess of Maha!!
21700_TRAIN_WITH_AN_INSTRUCTOR=No? Are you saying you can train on your own? I'm just letting you know that you'll get better results if you train with an instructor. You can't live in this world alone. You must learn to get along with other people.
21700_ANYTHING_ELSE_YOU_REMEMBER=It seems like you've started to remember things. Your Polearm must have recognized you. This means you are surely #bAran, the wielder of Polearms#k. Is there anything else you remember? Skills you used with the Polearm perhaps? Anything?
21700_IT_IS_PROGRESS=That's not a lot, but it's progress. Our focus, then, should be to get you back to the state before you were frozen. You may have lost your memory, but I'm sure it won't take long for you to recover the abilities that your body remembers.
21700_TRAIN_TRAIN=There is only one way to do that. Train! Train! Train! Train! If you continue to train, your body will instinctively remember its abilities. To help you through the process, I'll introduce you to an instructor.
21700_I_GAVE_YOU=I gave you a #bPolearm#k because I figured it would be best for you to use a weapon you're familiar with. It will be useful in your training.
21700_TRAINING_CENTER_TO_THE_LEFT=You'll find a Training Center if you exit to the #bleft#k. There, you'll meet #b#p1202006##k. I'm a bit worried because I think he may be struggling with bouts of Alzheimer's, but he spent a long time researching skills to help you. I'm sure you'll learn a thing or two from him.
21703_MOVE_ON_TO_BIGGER_AND_BETTER=I know it takes an incredible amount of strength and will to outdo your instructor, but you weren't meant to let yourself wither away. You must move on to bigger and better things! You must do everything you can to embrace your heroic nature!
21703_BEGINNING_TO_TAKE_SHAPE=Your abilities are really beginning to take shape. I am surprised that an old man like me was able to help you. I'm tearing up just thinking about how happy it makes me to have been of assistance to you. *Sniff sniff*
21703_FINAL_STAGE=Alright, here's the third and the final stage of training. Your last opponent is... #r#o9300343#s#k! Do you know anything about #o1210100#s?
21703_NATURAL_WARRIORS=They are natural warriors! They're born with a voracious appetite for food. They devour any food that's visible the moment they sweep by. Terrifying, isn't it?
21703_SHOW_ME_WHAT_YOU_ARE_MADE_OF=Okay, now... #bEnter the Training Center again#k, defeat #r30#k #o9300343#s, and show me what you're made of! You'll have to exert all your energy to defeat them! Go, go, go! Rise above me!
21703_GO_AND_TAKE_ON=Now go and take on those monstrous #o9300343#s!
21703_YOU_RELUCTANT_TO_LEAVE=Are you reluctant to leave your instructor? *Sniff sniff* I'm so moved, but you can't stop here. You are destined for bigger and better things!
21703_I_KNEW_YOU_HAD_IT_IN_YOU=Ah, you've come back after defeating all 30 #o9300343#s. I knew you had it in you... Even though you have no memories and few abilities, I could see that you were different! How? Because you're carrying around a Polearm, obviously!
21703_NOTHING_MORE_TO_TEACH=I have nothing more to teach you, as you've surpassed my level of skill. Go now! Don't look back! This old man is happy to have served as your instructor.
21703_REPORT_BACK=Now report back to #p1201000#. I know she'll be ecstatic when she sees the progress you've made!
21704_HOW_DID_THE_TRAINING_GO=How did the training go? The Penguin Teacher #p1202006# likes to exaggerate and it worried me knowing that he has bouts of Alzheimer's, but I'm sure he helped you. He's been studying the skills of heroes for a very long time.
21704_THAT_IS_GREAT=That's great! Honestly, though, I think it has less to do with the method of #p1202006#'s training and more to do with your body remembering its old abilities. #bI'm sure your body will remember more skills as you continue to train#k!  \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 500 exp
21712_I_WILL_EXPLAIN_AGAIN=You still don't understand what's going on? I'll explain it to you again if you talk to me one more time.
21712_CAN_ONLY_BE_HEARD=#t4032315#... #rThis puppet is making a strange noise#k. You can't hear it with your ears, of course, since it can only be heard by the #o1210102#s. I believe it's this noise that changed the personality of the #o1210102#s.
21712_TURNED_CYNICAL=The #o1210102#s that have been affected by the noise have turned cynical. They've started fighting the non-affected #o1210102#s, which has made all #o1210102#s prepare for combat. #bThe reason for all these changes in the #o1210102#s is this puppet#k! Do you understand?
21716_THINK_AGAIN=What? I don't think there are any suspects besides that kid. Please think again.
21716_VERY_SUSPICIOUS=A kid with a puppet? That seems very suspicious. I am sure that kid is the reason the Green Mushrooms have suddenly turned violent.
21719_STOP_BY_MY_CAVE=Me? If you want to know, stop by my cave. I'll even send you an invitation. You'll be directly sent to my cave as soon as you accept. Look forward to seeing you there.
21720_WOULD_YOU_LIKE_TO_SEE=Scared? Pfft. Who cares if the Black Magican appears. You'll be here to protect us. If anything, this makes me want to prepare you for the big battle. Ah, that reminds me, I found a #bskill#k. Would you like to see it?
21728_HAVE_NOT_FOUND_IT_YET=You haven't found the #rPuppeteer's cave#k yet, did you?
21728_ENTRANCE_IS_BLOCKED=Hm, so the entrance is blocked by a powerful force? I see, gimme a time to think now...
21729_SOMETHING_SCRIBBLED=Okay, you should not return to #bTru#k for further details on your next steps. ... Oh wait!! I remembered something. See the #rMysterious Statue#k over there? That statue has it's origins unknown, and there's something scribbled onto it that resembles something big, it probably is the password for the cave? #rGet the password there#k, it may help you on your journey.
21733_UNDER_ATTACK=Aran, Lith have been caught off guard. We are under attack! Get here ASAP.
21733_THANK_YOU=Aran, thank you very much! Somehow the Puppeteer managed to bypass the security of Lith Harbor. He was trying to seek revenge because of the other day. Luckily, you came by. Nicely done!
21733_I_WILL_TEACH_YOU=I will teach you the #rPolearm Mastery#k skill, to reward your actions here. You will be able to improve your accuracy and the overall mastery of your polearm arts.
21734_HELLO=Hello there, Aran. We received a report that the Puppeteer, one of the members of the Black Wing, is currently based #bsomewhere on the deep forest of Sleepywood#k. Your mission is to enter the place and defeat him there, once for all.
21734_YOU_MADE_IT=You made it, Aran! The Puppeteer now will not disturb the peace at Victoria Island any longer. Furthermore, now we could clearly investigate the doings of the Black Wing here, at Victoria.
21734_NOW_SAFE_AND_SOUND=They were after the #bcrystal seal of Victoria#k. These seals are what repels the Black Magician to further taking the continents into his grasp at once. Each continent has one, Victoria's now is safe and sound.
21734_REWARD=For your bravery inputted on these series of missions, I will now reward you properly. Behold, the #rCombo Drain#k Skill: that let's you heal back a portion of damage dealt to the monsters.
21735_DELIVER_THE_GEM=Aran, ever since the Puppeteer's ambush on me, I've been thinking it is dangerous to have the #b#t4032323##k around here by myself. So, I need you to deliver the gem to #r#p1201000##k, in Rien, she will know what to do with it.
21735_FREE_ETCH_SPACE=Please free a slot on your ETC inventory before receiving the item.
21735_GEM_WILL_BE_SAFER=#r#p1002104##k sent the #b#t4032323##k here for safety? Thank goodness, indeed here the gem will be safer than anywhere on Victoria Island. Thank you, #b#h0##k.
21736_LONG_TIME_NO_SEE=Long time no see! You've leveled up a lot since the last time we met. You must be training really hard. Always hard-working. I'm not surprised. It's exactly what a hero like you would do. I'm sure Lilin will be happy to hear about your progress.
21736_ENOUGH_SMALL_TALK=Anyway, enough small talk. I realized that it might be more effective to search for information in places outside Victoria Island as well, so I've begun investigating in Ossyria. I began with #bOrbis#k and immediately hit the jackpot.
21736_SOMETHING_STRANGE_IS_HAPPENING=It seems like something strange is happening in Orbis in Ossyria. It's a bit different from when we were dealing with the puppeteer, but my instincts tell me it has to do with the Black Wings. Please head over to Orbis.
21736_GO_SEE_LISA_FIRST=#bLisa the Fairy#k in Orbis should know a thing or two. Go see Lisa first, she knows someone that knows the whereabouts of the sealing stone. That person #rwill require a password from you#k, when requested use the #bThere's something strange going on in Orbis....#k keyword to talk to her. Understood?
21738_GIVE_ME_A_SECOND=Well, now let's look into your fate. Give me a second.
21739_YOU_DEFEATED_THE_GIANT=So, have you defeated the giant? Oh, a Black Wing agent undercover? And he GOT THE SEAL STONE OF ORBIS?! Oh, no. That's horrible! We need to develop countermeasures as soon as possible! Tell the informant on Lith about the situation.
21740_ORBIS_SEAL_STOLEN=The Orbis seal has been stolen by the Black Wings? Hmm, that has gone awry. Go tell #bLilin#k about this, she must have something in mind on this situation.
21740_UNCOVERED_A_LOST_SKILL=Oh, hi #h0#! You won't believe what I just uncovered. It's one of your lost skills... What, the seal of Orbis got stolen by the Black Wings? Oh my...
21740_LET_ME_TEACH_YOU=For now, let me teach you the #bCombo Smash#k, with it you will be able to deal massive amount of damage to many monsters at once. We will need to use it if we want to stand a chance against the Black Wings now, so don't forget it!
21741_HAVE_YOU_BEEN_ADVANCING=Have you been advancing your levels? I found an interesting piece of information about the Black Wings. This time, you'll have to travel quite a bit. Do you know a town called #bMu Lung#k? You'll have to head there.
21741_GO_FIND_OUT_WHY=Apparently, #bMr. Do#k in Mu Lung somehow met with the Black Wings. I don't know the details. Please go and find out why the Black Wings contacted Mr. Do and what exactly happened between them.
21741_REMAIN_PATIENT=Mr. Do is known to be curt, so you are going to have to remain patient while talking to him. Talk to him with the #bI heard you met the Shadow Knight of the Black Wings#k keyword.
21742_SLIGHT_PROBLEM=Well, the thing is... There is a slight problem, care to listen?
21742_LET_ME_POUR_IT=Oh, you brought the ink. Now let me pour it, cautiously.... Almost there, almost. ... ..... Kyaaa! Th-the letter. It says: 'I'll be there to take your Seal Rock of Mu Lung.'
21746_PASS_MY_TEST=If you want to know more about the Seal Rock of Mu Lung, you will need to pass my test. Prove your valor overpowering me in melee combat, only then I shall recognize you as a worthy knight.
21746_SOMEONE_ALREADY_ATTEMPTING=Someone is already attempting a challenge. Wait for them to finish before you enter.
21746_LET_ME_POUR_IT=Oh, you brought the ink. Now let me pour it, cautiously.... Almost there, almost. ... ..... Kyaaa! Th-the letter. It says: 'I'll be there to take your Seal Rock of Mu Lung.'
21747_WHO_WOULD_HAVE_THOUGHT=Who would have thought that the hero's successor would reappear after hundred of years...? Will you bring prosperity to Maple World or will you end its existence? I suppose it really doesn't matter. Alright, I'll tell you what I know about the Seal Stone of Mu Lung.
21747_PASSWORD_IS=The Seal Stone of Mu Lung is located at the Sealed Temple. You will find the entrance deep inside the Mu Lung Temple. You can enter the Sealed Temple if you find the pillar with the word 'Entrance' written on it. The password is: #bActions speak better than words#k. Maybe you will find the Shadow Knight there, as he probably is waiting for me there. I think the Hero's successor is more able to face him than myself, so prepare yourself.
21747_YOU_HANDLED_THE_TASK_WELL=So you have defeated the Shadow Knight. I have never doubted of your handiwork, and you handled the task well.
21747_WHAT_COULD_IT_BE=But yet, something made you unhappy. What could it be? ... No... Black Wings took away the Seal stone? I'm afraid nothing can be done anymore. I suggest you return to your group tactician, Tru is it?, and tell him about the situation now. Tell him about the loss here in Mu Lung. There's no time to lose, hurry!
21748_COME_BACK_HOME=Aran, you came back home safe! So, how fared the mission in Mu Lung? #rGentleman#k ambushed and stole the seal rock again? That's unfortunate. At least you are unharmed, I'm glad.
21748_FINE_IMPROVEMENT=I've researched some skill books, trying to trace any lost skills of yours. Good news I found one of them: it's the #rFinal Charge#k! With it you will be able to draw closer opposing monsters at each swipe. It's a fine improvement for your arsenal, isn't it?
21749_LOST_TWO_SEAL_STONES=So we have lost #btwo seal stones#k so far, from the neighboring areas of #rOrbis#k and #rMu Lung#k... Things are starting to get out of control, it seems.
21749_RETRIEVE_LONG_LOST_SEAL_STONE=Aran, your next objective will be to use the #btime gate to Ellin#k again. This time you will be retrieving the long lost #rSeal Stone of Ellin Forest#k. According to information our network has gathered, #b#p2131002##k of that time have a clue about that gem, #rfind her#k. Please be successful on this task, our world is relying on you more than ever!
21750_FINALLY_BACK=Aran, you're finally back!!! How you've been doing? Where did you go for so long? We have so much to catch up...
21753_DISCOVERED_SOMETHING_DISTURBING=Aran, I've discovered some disturbing news... You said you've come from the eastern forest section, right? We traced and studied the magic being used to support the portal over there. It turns out that's of a #rtemporal#k-type. The garments you're using... They were never seen around before. That must mean, #ryou must have come from the future#k.
21753_THE_PROBLEM=Now about the problem: the Seal Stone that seems to have been missing in your timeline... It is a powerful artifact, that prevents the army of the #rBlack Magician#k from laying siege on our world. If that stone goes away, nothing more can prevent him. As this is a matter of great importance, find the #rself of mine#k from the future. I'm actually a #rfairy#k with a great life expectancy, I must be alive even on your timeline. Got it, #rfetch the me from the future#k!
21754_NEED_AN_ETC_SPACE=Hm, I will need you to prepare a ETC slot for a letter I need to give you.
21754_TAKE_THIS=Here, take this. Send it to #r#p1002104##k, it contains a relevant matter for protecting this world. Please comply to this request.
21757_A_LETTER=Oh, a letter for the #rempress#k? From the #bheroes#k?!
21766_DO_ME_A_FAVOR=Hey! Can you do me a favor? #p20000# seems a bit strange these days...

21766_SECRET_BEHIND_THAT_WOODEN_BOX=I have a feeling there is a secret behind that wooden box. Could you stealthily look into the wooden box next to #p20000#?
21766_YOU_KNOW_WHERE=You know where #p20000# is, right? He's to the right. Just keep going until you see where Vikin is, then head down past the hanging shark and octopus, and you''ll see John. The box should be right next to him.
21767_OPEN_ETC_SPACE=Please open a slot in your ETC inventory first.
21767_BETTER_TAKE_IT_TO_JOHN=#bHm, there's a medicinal substance in the box. What could this be? You better take this to John and ask him what it is.#k

22000_TAKE_THIS_SHIP=Take this ship and you'll head off to a bigger continent. For #e150 mesos#n, I'll take you to #bVictoria Island#k. The thing is, once you leave this place, you can't ever come back. What do you think? Do you want to go to Victoria Island?
22000_THINGS_STILL_TO_DO=Hmm... I guess you still have things to do here?
22000_GIVE_ME_150_MESOS=Okay, now give me 150 mesos... Hey, what's that? Is that the recommendation letter from Lucas, the chief of Amherst? Hey, you should have told me you had this. I, Shanks, recognize greatness when I see one, and since you have been recommended by Lucas, I see that you have a great, great potential as an adventurer. No way would I charge you for this trip!
22000_BORED_OF_THIS_PLACE=Bored of this place? Here... Give me #e150 mesos#n first...
22000_RECOMMENDATION_LETTER=Since you have the recommendation letter, I won't charge you for this. Alright, buckle up, because we're going to head to Victoria Island right now, and it might get a bit turbulent!!

22004_I_WAS_WORRIED=The #o1210100#s at the farm have been acting strange these past couple days. They've been angry and irritable for no reason. I was worried so I came out to the farm early this morning and sure enough, it seems like a few of these #o1210100#s got past the fence.
22004_BEFORE_I_GO=Before I go and find the #o1210100#s, I should mend the broken fence. Luckily, it wasn't damaged too badly. I just need a few #t4032498#es to fix it right up. Will you bring me #b3#k #b#t4032498#es#k, Evan?

22004_I_MADE_THIS_CHAIR=Here. I made this new chair from the wooden boards I had left over after fixing the fence. It may not seem like much, but it's sturdy. I'm sure it'll come in handy.

22007_THAT_IS_STRANGE=Hm? That's strange. The Incubator wasn't installed properly. Try again.
22008_IT_IS_STRANGE=It's strange. The chickens are acting funny. They used to hatch way more #t4032451#s. Do you think the Foxes have something to do with it? If so, we better hurry up and do something.
22008_ARE_YOU_SCARED_OF=Oh what... Are you scared of the #o9300385#es? Don't tell anyone you're related to me. That's shameful.
22008_DEFEAT_THOSE_FOXES=Right? Let us go and defeat those Foxes. Go on ahead and defeat #r10 #o9300385#es#k in #b#m100030103##k first. I'll follow you and take care of what's left behind. Now, hurry over to #m100030103#!
22008_DID_YOU_DEFEAT=Did you defeat the #o9300385#es?
22008_I_DID_CHASE_THEM=Oh, that? Haha. I did chase them, sort of, but I wanted to make sure that they catch up to you. I wouldn't want you eaten by a #o9300385# or anything. So I just let them be.

22008_THIS_IS_A_WEAPON=#bThis is a weapon that Magicians use. It's a Wand#k. You probably won't really need it, but it'll make you look important if you carry it around. Hahahahaha.
22008_HOW_WEIRD_IS_THAT=Anyway, the Foxes have increased, right? How weird is that? Why are they growing day by day? We should really look into it and get to the bottom of this.
2214_CANNOT_FIND=(Hmm, I'm searching the trash can but can't find the #t4031894# JM was talking about, maybe it's not time yet...)
2214_NEED_ETC_SLOT=(Eh, I can't hold the #t4031894# right now, I need an ETC slot available.)
2214_CRUMBLED_NOTE=(Ah, there is a crumbled note here... Hm, it contains details about some scheme that is about to happen, that must be what #r#p1052002##k was talking about.)
2215_CANNOT_FIND=(Hmm, I'm searching the trash can but can't find the #t4031894# JM was talking about, maybe it's not time yet...)

2215_NEED_ETC_SLOT=(Eh, I can't hold the #t4031894# right now, I need an ETC slot available.)

2216_GATHERED_INFORMATION=I've just gathered an interesting information, #rDyle looks just like regular Ligators#k, but bigger.

2228_THANK_YOU=Thank you for defeating #rFaust#k. That will finally settle my spirit to rest.

2230_HELLO=Hello, traveler... You have finally come to see me. Have you fulfilled your duties? \r\n #b#L0#What duties? Who are you?#l#k
2230_HAVE_YOU_FOUND=Have you found a small egg in your pocket? That egg is your duty, your responsibility. Life is hard when you're all by yourself. In times like this, there's nothing quite like having a friend that will be there for you at all times. Have you heard of a #bpet#k?\r\nPeople raise pets to ease the burden, sorrow, and loneliness, because knowing that you have someone, or something in this matter, on your side will really bring a peace of mind. But everything has consequences, and with it comes responsibility...
2230_RAISING_A_PET=Raising a pet requires a huge amount of responsibility. Remember a pet is a form of life, as well, so you'll need to feed it, name it, share your thoughts with it, and ultimately form a bond. That's how the owners get attached to these pets.
2230_I_WANT_TO_INSTAILL_THIS_IN_YOU=I wanted to instill this in you, and that's why I sent you a baby that I cherish. The egg you have brought is #bRune Snail#k, a creature that is born through the power of Mana. Since you took great care of it as you brought the egg here, the egg will hatch soon.
2230_PET_OF_MANY_SKILLS=Rune Snail is a pet of many skills. It'll pick up items, feed you with potions, and do other things that will astound you. The downside is that since Rune Snail was born out of power of Mana, it's lifespan is very short. Once it turns into a doll, it'll never be able to be revived.
2230_NOW_DO_YOU_UNDERSTAND=Now do you understand? Every action comes with consequences, and pets are no exception. The egg of the snail shall hatch soon.
2230_FREE_A_CASH_SLOT=Please free a slot in your CASH inventory before you try to receive the pet...
2230_SHOWER_IT_WITH_LOVE=This snail will only be alive for #b5 hours#k. Shower it with love. Your love will be reciprocated in the end.

22500_MY_MASTER_IS_STRANGE=My master is strange. I guess I can't do anything about it now, since the pact has been made. *sigh* Well, good to meet you. We'll be seeing a lot of each other.
22500_YOU_WOKE_ME=What do you mean what do I mean?! You woke me from the Egg. You're my master! So of course it's your responsibility to take care of me and train me and help me become a strong Dragon. Obviously!
22500_WHAT_ARE_YOU_TALKING_ABOUT=What are YOU talking about? Your spirit made a pact with my spirit! We're pretty much the same person now. Do I really have to explain? As a result, you've become my master. We're bound by the pact. You can't change your mind... The pact cannot be broken.
22500_YOU_DO_NOT_WANT_TO_BE=Yuuup! Heeeey...! What's with the face? You...don't want to be my master?
22500_A_PET=A p-p-pet?! Did you just call me a pet?! How dare... Why, I'm a Dragon! The strongest being in the world!
22500_SEE_WHAT_I_CAN_DO=Why are you looking at me like that?! Just watch! See what I can do with my power. Ready?
22500_DO_NOT_BELIEVE_ME=You don't believe me? Grrrrr, you're getting me mad!
22500_COMMAND_ME_TO=Command me to slay the #r#o1210100##ks! Do it now! I'll show you how fast a Dragon can defeat the #o1210100#s! Goooo, charge!
22500_DISTRIBUTE_AP=Wait a minute! Did you distribute your AP? I'm heavily affected by my master's #bINT and LUK#k! If you really want to see what I can do, distribute your AP and #bequip your Magician equipment#k before you use the skill!
22501_PROVE_TO_ME=Yo, master. Now that I've shown you what I can do, it's your turn. Prove to me...that you can find food! I'm starving. You can use my power now, so you have to take care of me.
22501_HELLO=Hi, I was just born a few minutes ago. How would I know what I eat? All I know is that I'm a Dragon... I'm YOUR Dragon. And you're my master. You have to treat me well!
22501_LEARN_TOGETHER=I guess we're supposed to learn together. But I'm hungry. Master, I want food. Remember, I'm a baby! I'll start crying soon!
22501_GASP=*gasp* How can you refuse to feed your Dragon? This is child abuse! 
22501_EXTREMELY_HUNGRY=#b#b(#p1013000# the baby Dragon appears to be extremely hungry. You must feed him. Maybe your Dad can give you advice on what dragons eat.)
22502_LIKE_A_COW=Wouldn't a lizard enjoy a #b#t4032452##k, like a cow? There are a lot of #bHaystacks#k nearby, so try feeding it that.
22502_NEVER_KNOW=Hm, you never know unless you try. That lizard is big enough to be on Maple's Believe It Or Not. It might eat hay.
22503_THIS_IS_NOT_WHAT_I_NEED=No, no, no. This isn't what I need. I need something more nutritious, master!
22503_NEVER_HEARD_OF_IT=What's a...#t4032453#? Never heard of it, but if it's yummy, I accept! Just feed me something tasty. Anything but plants!
22503_HOW_CAN_YOU_STARVE_ME=How can you starve me like this. I'm just a baby. This is wrong!
22503_TRY_GIVING=#b#b(Try giving #p1013000# some #t4032453#. You have to hunt a few #o1210100#s at the farm. Ten should be plenty...)
22504_THIS_IS_NOT_GOING_TO_WORK=Ugh. This isn't going to work. I need something else. No plants. No meat. What, you have no idea? But you're the master, and you're older than me, too. You must know what'd be good for me!
22504_MORE_EXPERIENCED=Since you're older, you must be more experienced in the world, too. Makes sense that you'd know more than me. Oh, fine. I'll ask someone who's even older than you, master!
22504_BETTER_LOOK_FOR_SOMEONE_OLDER_AND_WISER=No use trying to find an answer to this on my own. I'd better look for #bsomeone older and wiser than master#k!
22504_ASK_DAD=#b#b(You already asked Dad once, but you don't have any better ideas. Time to ask him again!)
22507_I_KNEW_IT=I knew it! I knew we were connected, master! When you get stronger, I get stronger, too. And when I get stronger, you can use my strength! That's our pact. I knew I picked a good master!
22507_I_CANNOT_REMEMBER=I don't know. I was just an egg. I can't really remember...though I faintly recall you, master, walking toward me in a foggy forest. I remember your surprise upon seeing me. And I was calling out to you in return.
22507_YOU_AND_I_ARE_ONE=Master, you and I are one in spirit. I knew it the moment I saw you. That's why I wanted to make the pact with you. No one else. You had to pay the price I set, of course.
22507_DO_YOU_NOT_REMEMBER=Don't you remember? When you recognized me and touched me? That was the one condition I set. The moment you touched my egg, you and I became one in spirit.
22507_SPIRIT_PACT=Yes! The Spirit Pact! You and I have separate bodies, but we share one spirit. That's why you get stronger when I get stronger, and vice versa! Awesome, right? At least, I think so.
22507_BIG_DEAL=Of course it's a big deal, silly master! You never have to worry about monsters again. You have me to protect you now! Go ahead and test me. In fact, let's go right now!
22507_THAT_IS_NO_FUN=WHAT?! That's no fun! Don't you like adventuring, master? Fighting monsters on behalf of your people, defeating evil, rescuing the innocent, and all that? You're not into that kind of thing?
22507_LET_ME_TELL_YOU_THIS=Bah, well let me tell you this. It's impossible for a Dragon Master to live a peaceful life. I'll have plenty of chances to prove my skills. Trust me, our life will be one big adventure. Promise me that you'll stick with me, okay?\r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 810 exp
22507_YOU_ARE_KIDDING_ME=Uh, you're kidding me, right? Tell me your finger slipped! Go ahead and accept the quest.

2259_NO_MEERKAT_NEARBY=Oh there you are. There're no Meerkat's nearby, so there probably is no eavesdropping around here. Very well, you must be fit to go to the #rMushroom Castle#k. Talk to me once you've got #blevel 30#k.
2260_MUSHROOM_CASTLE_INTRO=Once you've got #b2nd job advancement#k, I'll tell you about the #bMushroom Castle#k.

2300_SOMETHING_TERRIBLE=I am not aware of the exact details, but it's obvious something terrible had taken place, so I think it'll be better if you go there and assess the damage yourself.

2314_GREAT_WORK=I see, so it was indeed not a regular barrier by any means. Great work there. If not for you help, we wouldn't have had a clue as to what that was all about.

2317_I_REMEMBER=Ah! If I am not mistaken, I saw the #bKiller Mushroom Spores#k way back when I was a kid in a book.

2319_NOT_A_TOUGH_TASK=I know it's not a tough task, so come back to me if you're ready.
2319_I_ALMOST_FORGOT=Oh, I almost forgot! What was I thinking? I need you to hand this #bSample of Killer Mushroom Spores#k to #bMinister of Magic#k and report the results.
2319_GIVE_YOU_THE_SAMPLE=The #bMinister of Magic#k told me once the #bKiller Mushroom Spores#k is complete, that he'll want a sample of it as well. I'll give you the sample; now go please hand it in to our #bMinister of Magic.#k

2320_ONE_MORE_REQUEST=I have just one more request for you. Would you like to take a listen?
2320_DO_YOU_REMEMBER=To be honest, these #bKiller Mushroom Spores#k are not completely out of my own work. Do you remember #bBruce#k from #bHenesys#k? I have been friends with him since childhood, and #bKiller Mushroom Spores#k was completed after he shared the results of his studies with me. This was all thanks to him, so I'd like for you to give this to him for me.
2320_OH=Oh! You're here on behalf of #bScarrs#k? \r\n\r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/4/0# \r\n#fUI/UIWindow.img/QuestIcon/8/0# 8800 exp
2320_PLEASE_TELL=Ahh, so this is the #bKiller Mushroom Spores#k that I was working on in the past. I had a tough time gathering up the ingredients, so I left it in theory only, but he was able to complete it, with a sample to show for as well. Please tell him I appreciate his good work.
2321_COME_SEE_ME_WHEN_YOU_ARE_READY=You don't seem to follow instructions well. Come see me when you are ready.
2321_PLEASE_GO_SEE_HIM=Now you'll be able to penetrate the spiny vine barrier of Mushroom Forest, but before that, #bMinister of Home Affairs#k wants to have a word with you. Please go see him immediately.
2321_GOOD_LUCK=Good luck.
2321_CONGRATULATIONS=I have been keeping up on your fabulous work. I am aware that you have successfully created the #bKiller Mushroom Spores#k, which penetrates through the impenetrable barrier of the forest. Congratulations!
2321_PROBLEM_NOW=The problem now is to figure out how to enter the castle.
2322_COME_SEE_ME=Really? Is there another way you can penetrate the castle? If you don't know of one, then just come see me.
2322_JUST_BREAKING_THE_BARRIER=Like I told you, just breaking the barrier cannot be a cause for celebration. That's because our castle for the Kingdom of Mushroom completely denies entry of anyone outside our kingdom, so it'll be hard for you to do that. Hmmm... to figure out a way to enter, can you...investigate the outer walls of the castle first?
2322_GOOD_LUCK=Walk past the Mushroom Forest and when you reach the #bSplit Road of Choice#k, just walk towards the castle. Good luck.
2322_GOOD_JOB=Good job navigating through the area.
2322_SHUT_OFF_ENTRANCE=Hmmm I see... so they have completely shut off the entrance and everything.
2325_I_AM_SCARED=I... I am scared... Please... please help me...

2327_I_PLAN_TO_ESCAPE=I plan to escape from here wearing the #b#t4001317##k. Give me a minute to put it on. Talk to you soon...

2333_HURRAY=Hurray! #b#h ##k you defeated the #bPrime Minister#k.
2334_THANK_YOU=Thank you so much, #b#h ##k. You are the hero that has saved our empire from danger. I'm so grateful for what you've done. I dont know how to thank you. And please understand why I can't show you my face.
2334_IT_IS_HUMILIATING=It's humiliating to say this, but ever since I was a baby, my family has kept my face veiled from the world. They feared of men falling hopelessly in love with me. I've grown so accustomed to it that I even shy away from women. I know, it's rude of me to have my back turned against the hero, but I'll need some time to muster my courage before I can greet you face to face.
2334_I_AM_SO_SHY=I'm so shy, I'm blushing. Anyways, thank you, #b#h ##k.
2335_NOT_THE_END=This is not the end, #b#h ##k. Minions of the #bPrime Minister#k can still be found scattered throughout the castle.
2335_FROM_WHAT_I_HAVE_HEARD=From what I've heard, there is a place near #bSkyscraper 3#k where a group of Prime Minister's minions can be found. I've picked up a key that the Prime Minister dropped the other day. Here, use this key.
2335_GOOD_LUCK=For one last time, good luck.
2335_ETC_SPACE_NEEDED=Please have a free space in your ETC inventory.
2338_YOU_ALREADY_HAVE=It looks like you already have one #b#t2430014##k on your inventory.
2338_I_HAVE_A_SPARE=You've used the #b#t2430014##k? Oh well, good thing I have a spare one right here.
2338_MAKE_USE_SPACE=Please make a USE slot available to get it, alright?
2342_LOOKS_LIKE_YOU_FORGOT=Looks like you forgot to pick up the #b#t4001318##k when you fought with the #bPrime Minister#k. This is very important to our kingdom, so please deliver this to my father as soon as possible.
2342_ETC_SPACE_NEEDED=Please free up one spot in your ETC inventory
2560_OOK_OOK=Ooook! Ook! Ook!
2560_COULD_NOT_HURT_TO_ASK=Oook! (The monkey nods. Does he really know what's going on? Couldn't hurt to ask.)
2560_DISSATISFIED=Ook! Ook! (The monkey looks very dissatisfied.)
2561_OOK_OOK=Ook, ook! Oook! Ook! Ook! Ook?!
2561_OOK_OOK_OOK_OOK=Oook! Ook! Ook! Oooook!
2561_ANGRILY=Ooook! Ook! Ook! (Huh, a little monkey...tapping its foot angrily. Actually, when I first woke up, that monkey was the only thing I saw...)
2561_FRUSTRATED=Ook ook! Om nom nom! (The monkey looks frustrated that you don't understand him. He pretends to eat the apple. Wait, does he want YOU to eat it? That must be it! What a nice monkey.)
2568_LETS_ROLL=You're back! Great. I got the Ignition Device all hooked up, so we can get back to civilization. Nothing left to do here, right? Let's roll!
2570_GOOD_TO_SEE_YOU=Good to see you, #h0#. So...you're the one that helped Cutter return. I saw you were hurt when you first arrived...are you okay now? You must be made of stern stuff. No wonder Cutter regards you so highly. My name is Kyrin. I'm captain of the Nautilus, as well as the Job Instructor for Pirates.
2570_CANNONEER_INFO=Cutter told you that he wants you to become a #bCannoneer#k, right? I agree with him, but I'm worried that your heart might not be in it. Maybe if you knew more about the pirates, you would be more interested. Let me tell you a little about us.
2570_HERO_BUSINESS_IS_PROFITABLE=I brought the pirates together to start working against the Black Magician, the great evil that threatens all of Maple World. Turns out the hero business is more profitable than looting and pillaging!
2570_PIRATE_JOB_INSTRUCTOR=If you become a Pirate, you can help investigate the Black Magician's plots, and assist in the defense of Maple World. Keep in mind that I won't make you do anything...I'm primarily a Job Instructor, and just guide the pirates in a general sense.
2570_I_HAVE_SAID_MY_PIECE=But, I know you would help us fight the Black Magician. You have that gleam in your eye that all heroes do. Anyway, I've said my piece.
2570_DO_YOU_WISH_TO_JOIN=Now, it's all up to you. Do you wish to join the pirates? I would be quite pleased if you became a Cannoneer. 
2570_I_UNDERSTAND=Oh. So...you want to be something else? I understand...but Cutter might not...
2570_ONE_OF_US=Well, you are truly one of us now. Open up your Skill window and check out your new Pirate abilities. I also gave you a few extra SP, so you can go ahead and boost some of your new skills. You'll get more skills at higher levels, so I suggest you have a plan for your training.
2570_DISTRIBUTE_STATS=Skills alone do not make you a great pirate. You have to distribute your stats like a pirate, too! If you're hoping to become a Cannoneer, invest heavily in STR so you can hold that heavy cannon of yours. And if you just have no idea, use the #bauto-distribute#k option. Simple, and effective.
2570_LITTLE_GIFT=Oh, I gave you a little gift, too. I expanded a few slots in your Equip and ETC Item tabs, so you should have plenty of room for your spoils!
2570_ONE_LAST_THING=Now, there is one last thing that you need to remember. More than anything else, you need to keep your HP up. If you fall in battle, you'll lose some of your EXP. And I'm SURE you don't want that, right?
2570_THAT_IS_IT=Well, that's it! I have taught you everything you need to know. I also gave you a few decent weapons, so make good use of them. Now, go forth, grow stronger, and kick around the Black Magician's minions, if you get the chance!
2573_GREETINGS=Greetings! Isn't this just the perfect weather for a journey? I'm Skipper, the captain of this fine ship. You must be a new Explorer, eh? Nice to meet you.
2573_NOT_QUITE_READY=We're not quite ready to leave, so feel free to look around the ship while we're waiting.
2573_TAKE_IT_EASY=Hey, take it easy! Sometimes you just gotta wait.
2573_WE_ARE_ALL_SET=Looks like we're all set! I think this is going to be a great voyage. Let's get underway.
28004_HERE_IS_OUR_PLAN=Okay... so here's our plan to defeat Scrooge and his dastardly plans. The Force of the Spirit I gave you is an item packed with mana. It's an item you'll definitely use at the map I am about to send you. In order to do that, you'll have to bring your party members with you as well. You should bring your party members here or form one right now!
28004_MOVE_FORWARD=Would you like to move forward?

3108_BETTER_TALK_TO=(As you peek into the shattered statue, you might have found a clue about what happened. Better talk to #rScadur#k about this.)

3303_NO_ORE_NO_DEAL=What is this, you don't have the #rjewel ores#k with you. No ore, no deal.
3303_NO_ORE_NO_DEAL_2=What's this, you haven't got the #rjewel ores#k. No ores no deal!
3303_WAIT_FOR_A_WHILE=Then wait for awhile. I'll go and get the stuff to help you pass the test of Chief Zenumist.
3314_THAT_IS_THE_RESULT=You did took my experiments. Hmm, so THAT is the result of it, hehehehe... Ok, take that as compensation will you? And oh, you can #rspew that#k right away (#bright-click on the pill icon at the top-right corner of the screen#k), no worries.
3314_USE_SPACE_NEEDED=Huh, your inventory is full. Free some spaces on your USE first.
3314_TAKE_THE_PILL=You seem pretty normal, don't you? I can't detect any possible effect from my experiment on you. Go take the pill I asked you to take and show me the effects, will you?
3320_ARE_YOU_READY=I may have an idea of the whereabouts of Dr. De Lang. Are you ready to be transported to the area?
3321_HELLO=As you may know by now, I am Dr. De Lang. Once an affluent alchemist amongst the ranks of the Alcadno society, I have been disconnected from their society due to the disaster of the aftermatch of my failed experiments, that can be seen now all over Magatia.
3321_MY_CREATION=Huroids, my creation, were originally engineered to fulfill both domestic, scientific and military affairs, however a critical malfunction on their main processing unit chips rendered them unstable and violent, rapidly causing upheavals and havoc all over the place. Due to that, I've been stripped of my status as Alcadno's alchemist and researcher and got myself an arrest warrant.
3321_I_MUST_NOT_BE_STOPPED=Even so, I must not be stopped now! Creations of mine are still roaming around causing destruction and casualities every day, with no great hopes of repelling them from the city! They can replicate themselves too fast, normal weapons cannot stop them. I've been since relentlessly researching a way to shut them down all at once, trying to find a way to stop this insanity. Surely you can understand my situation?
3321_MY_GRATITUDE=My gratitude for understanding my point. You must have met Parwen, since you know where I am. Make him aware of the current situation.
3321_PERSONAL_FAVOR=Oh, and I have a personal favor to ask, if it's not too much. I am worried about my wife, #b#p2111004##k. Since the incident with the Huroids I could send a word to her, that must have made a toll on her... Please, if you could, could you get the #bSilver Pendant#k I left #bback at home#k, and give it to her in my stead? I regret not giving the item right away to her, it was her birthday... Maybe giving it now to her can get her a good sleeping night, at least.
3321_REMEMBER=#rMake sure to remember this pattern!#k I've hid the pendant in my house, in a container #bbehind the water pipes#k. The pipes must be turned #bin order#k: top, bottom, middle. And then, enter the secret password: '#rmy love Phyllia#k'.
3345_WELL_DONE=So, you have succeeded. With this, Magatia's upfront demise has been averted, well done brave adventurer!
3345_HASTE_YOURSELF=Did you not seal the #rmagic circle beneath Magatia#k yet? It is a matter of great importance, please haste yourself.
3353_THAT_IS_WHY=I see. De Lang wants to stop the Huroids from causing more destruction, but the societies would like to get him on jail at once. So that's why he hid himself there.
3353_GO_THERE_AGAIN=In that case, go there again and hear more details from De Lang, will you?
3354_I_HAVE_A_REQUEST=I have a request for you. Can you ask #bMaed#k for a potion of my devise? Obviously, don't mention I have asked you that, that would be a problem. #bKeeny#k got an illness due to the contact with the Huroids, this have bothering me so much I couldn't give progress on my researches... Please #rbring her the potion#k, so that I could feel better and start making progress. I'm counting on you.
3360_COME_ON=Come on, hurry up. Get your pen and paper out if you're not that smart!
3360_FINALLY=Oh! Finally you have come! I'm glad you are here in time. I have the master key for you to open the secret passage! Hahahaha! Isn't it amazing? Say it amazing!
3360_ALL_RIGHT=All right, now, this key is very long and complex. I need you to memorize it very well. I won't say again, so you'd better write it down somewhere. Are you ready?
3360_KEY_CODE=The key code is #b{0}#k. Got that? Put the key into the door of the secret passage, and you will be able to walk around the passage freely.
3382_THANK_YOU=Thank you for retrieving the marbles. Accept this pendant as a token of my appreciation.
3382_EQUIP_SLOT_NEEDED=Free a slot on your EQUIP tab before claiming a prize.
3382_THANK_YOU_LONG=Thank you for retrieving the marbles. This rock, that I am giving to you, can be used to improve the stats on the #b#t1122010##k. Take it as a token of my appreciation and use it wisely.
3382_USE_SLOT_NEEDED=Free a slot on your USE tab before claiming a prize.
3382_I_NEED_AT_LEAST=I need at least #b10 of both #t4001159# and #t4001160##k to reward you appropriately. If you happen to come with #b25 of these#k instead, I can reward you with a valuable gear. Fare well.
3414_WHOA=Whoa... this is it!!! With this sample, the studies that are taking place in Omega Sector will be reinvigorated with results! I am also at a loss for words for finding someone that is more talented than me at hunting. I'll have to get back on track! Anyway, for your job well done, I'll have to reward you accordingly.
3414_free10rate_WHOA=Whoa... this is it!!! With this sample, the studies that are taking place in Omega Sector will be reinvigorated with results! I am also at a loss for words for finding someone that is more talented than me at hunting. I'll have to get back on track! Anyway, for your job well done, I'll have to reward you accordingly.
3437_WHAT_THE=What the? Are you telling me you've already taken out 150 #o4230120#s? And these ... yes, these really are 120 #t4000122#s. I was wondering how you were going to complete this mission all by yourself, but you took care of it just fine. Alright, here ... this is a very important item for me, but please take it.
3437_EQUIP_SLOT_NEEDED=Please free a EQUIP inventory slot to receive the reward.

3507_CHECK_WITH_TEACHER=You have not yet checked with your first teacher about your memories?
3514_NICE_DOING_BUSINESS=Nice doing business with you~~.
3514_USE_SLOT_NEEDED=Check out for a slot on your USE inventory first.
3514_NO_MONEY=Oy, you don't have the money. I charge #r1,000,000 mesos#k for the emotion potion. No money, no deal.
3514_ARE_YOU_SCARED=Are you scared to drink the potion? I can assure you it has only a minor #rside effect#k.
3514_LOST_IT=Lost it? Luckily for you I managed to recover it back. Take it.
3514_LOST_IT_MAKE_ROOM=Lost it? Luckily for you I managed to recover it back. Make a room to get it.
3514_POTION_WORKED=It seems the potion worked and your emotions are no longer frozen. And, oh, my... You're ailing bad, #bpurge#k that out quickly.
3523_REGAINED_MEMORIES=You have regained your memories, talk to #b#p2140001##k to get the pass.
3524_REGAINED_MEMORIES=You have regained your memories, talk to #b#p2140001##k to get the pass.
3525_REGAINED_MEMORIES=You have regained your memories, talk to #b#p2140001##k to get the pass.

3833_COULD_YOU_MAKE=Could you make #b2 slots available#k on your USE inventory before receiving your reward?
3933_DID_NOT_THINK_YOU_WOULD_BE=I didn't think you would be this strong. I feel like you have what it takes to become a member of the Sand Bandits. The most important aspect of being a member is power, and I think you have that. I also... want to test you one more time, just to make sure you're the right one. What do you think? Can you handle it?
3933_TRULY_SEE_YOUR_STRENGTH=To truly see your strength, I'll have to face you myself. Don't worry, I'll summon my other self to face off against you. Are you ready?

3933_SOMEONE_CURRENTLY_IN_MAP=There is someone currently in this map, come back later.
3941_WHAT_IS_THIS=What's this? I can't simply give the Queen's silk to anyone, claiming they will hand it at once to the queen. Get out of my sights.
3941_WHAT_ARE_YOU_DOING_HERE=Tigun, what are you doing here?
3941_WANTS_HER_SILK=The Queen wants her silk right now? Alright, I have them here. Hold on a moment.
3941_GET_OUT_OF_MY_SIGHTS=What's this? I can't simply give the Queen's silk to anyone, claiming they will hand it at once to the queen. Get out of my sights.
3941_THERE_YOU_GO=There you go. Please deliver to the queen as soon as possible, Tigun, she gets really mad if things get delayed.
3941_YOU_ARE_LACKING_SPACE=Hey, you're lacking space to hold this, man. I will stay with it while you arrange your backpack...
3953_DEO_IS_NOT_A_MONSTER=Eh, are you still saying Deo is a monster? No, Deo is not a monster, he is a peaceful leader of the Royal cactus from the region.\r\n\r\n#L0##bHave you heard that a group of merchants crossing through the desert were attacked by the monsters?#k
3953_IS_THAT_SO=Is that so? I wonder why these merchants were wandering so recklessly in the desert. They trespassed the territory of the Cactus'! They shouldn't be wandering around in the first place, they should first have the leave of the Ariant Counsel.\r\n\r\n#L0##bThis is all because of the Queen's negligence in maintaining the safety of the town.#k
3953_NOT_REALLY_DOING_WELL=Ehh... Yeah, the city is not really doing well because of the currently ruling govern, that's indeed a fact. If only the Guardians of the Deserts returned to put order on this mess...\r\n\r\n#L0##bWhat is the Guardian of the Deserts doing when we're under the Queen's tyranny?#k
3953_THEY_HAVE_DEPARTED=They have departed on an expedition to get rid of some major threats in the desert that were ravaging Ariant, for quite some time now... It's strange, they should have already returned... Thinking about it now, the last attack on the merchants was around the direction the Guardians departed... No, that can't be... Can it?\r\n\r\n#L0##bPerhaps Deo has already turned into a monster.#k
3953_IN_GREAT_TROUBLE=We're in great trouble, if it is like this. And it really seems like it. If the Royal Cactus Deo has gone insane, Ariant is done for. You, can you do something to defeat Deo? We really need your help now.
4647_THANKS=You got the Pet Snack! Thanks! You can use these to feed multiple pets at once!
4647_GET_ME_THE_SNACK=Get me the Pet Snack! It can be found in a very big shop....
4659_I_NEED_MESOS=Hey! I need #b10,000 mesos#k to do your pet's evolution!
4659_GREAT_JOB=Great job on finding your evolution materials. I will now give you a robot.
4659_NOT_GROWN_ENOUGH=It looks like your pet is not grown enough to be evolved yet. Train it a bit more, util it reaches #blevel 15#k.
4659_SOMETHING_IS_WRONG=Something wrong. Try again.
6030_FUNDAMENTALS=I am to teach you about the fundamentals of Alchemy.
6030_GOOD_TO_TAKE_A_LOOK=While science is good to take a look on the thoughtful side of the elements that compounds the items, it alone is not nearly enough to devise an item.
6030_IN_FACT=In fact, to be able to 'tell the pieces' to become a whole, how should it be done? The rustic ways of the blacksmithing winds up dumbing down some latent potentials of the items.
6030_ALCHEMY_CAN_BE_EMPLOYED=Alchemy can be employed for this task. Cleanly and swiftly, #rit merges the parts that forms an item with almost no drawbacks#k, making out the most of the process with almost no scrap, if done right. It takes a while to master it, but once it is done, everything will run out neatly.
6030_AND_REMEMBER=And remember this: the maxima of #bExchange#k, the area of the fundamentals of Alchemy where the total amount of the material does not change, is that no item can be created from nothing. Understood?
6031_I_AM_TO_TEACH_YOU=I am to teach you about the basics of the Theory of Science.
6031_SCIENCE_STAGES=Science stages where the alchemy doesn't meet the requirements. All items have molecular constitutions. The #rnature of their arrangements and each intrinsic unit of matter#k defines the many properties an item will have.
6031_THIS_MAKES_TRUE=This makes true in the scenario of the #rMaker#k as well. One must be able to study the traces of each component that is being used to form the item, to be able to tell if the experiment will either succeed or fail.
6031_TAKE_THAT_IN_MIND=Take that in mind: the main perspective of science, that one engine that makes it flows the strongest, whatever scenario it is, is the aspect of #bunderstanding the process#k that generates the results, not simply throwing away tries at will.
6031_THAT_HAS_BEEN_MADE_CLEAR=That has been made clear, right? Good, then the class is over. Dismissed.
6032_ATTEND_MY_CLASS=So you've come to attend my class, huh? Right, I'll make it fast.
6032_I_WILL_TEACH_YOU=I will teach you the actual application of the #bMaker#k method. All you need to do is have an item in mind to make, gather all the ingredients from the receipt and mix them in a #ralchemistic way#k. Easy, isn't it?
6032_AS_AN_EXAMPLE=Let's take producing the #bWeight Earrings#k as an example. There is a rather specific #rductility theory#k to generate it, as any other 'unique' items have, the name going around the #rmain physical force#k acting over the thing we are working on: on that case, the #bDuctility Theory of Gravity#k (as it is a 'Weighted Earrings', got it?).
6032_HAND_ME_A_FEE=Ok, now you need to hand me a fee, 10,000 mesos that is, for that information. The collected fee shall be used for acquiring the needed materials for your learning of the fine art of the #bMaker#k.
6033_LET_US_TAKE_A_LOOK=Hm, so you claim to have brought the #b#t4260003##k? Ok, let's take a look into it.
6033_FINE_PIECE=You indeed have crafted a fine piece of Monster Crystal, I see. You passed! Now, I shall teach you the next steps of the Maker skill. Keep the monster crystal with you as well, it's your work.
6033_WHAT_IS_WRONG=Hey, what's wrong? I did tell you to make a monster crystal to pass my test, didn't I? Buying one or crafting before the start of the test is NOT part of the deal. Go craft me an #b#t4260003##k.

9201050_PAY_ATTENTION=Hey, pay attention, I'm trying to quiz you on another question, fam!
9201050_ALWAYS_DREAMED=I've always dreamed of building a city. Not just any city, but one where everyone was welcome. I used to live in Kerning City, so I decided to see if I could create a city. As I went along in finding the means to do so, I encountered many people, some of whom I've come to regard as friends. Like Professor Foxwit-he's our resident genius; saved him from a group of man-eating plants. Jack Masque is an old hunting buddy from Amoria-almost too smooth of a talker for his own good. Lita and I are old friends from Kerning City-she's saved me a few times with that weapon of hers; so I figured she was a perfect choice for Town Sheriff. It took a bit of persuasion, but she came to believe her destiny lies here. About our resident explorer, Barricade came searching for something; he agreed to bring whatever he found to the museum. I'd heard stories about him and his brother when I was still in Kerning City. And Elpam...well, let's just say he's not from around here. At all. We've spoken before, and he seems to mean well, so I've allowed him to stay. I just realized that I've rambled quite a bit! What else would you like to know?
9201050_PRETTY_SPRY=A pretty spry guy for being 97. He's a time-traveller I ran into outside the city one day. Old guy had a bit of trouble with some jungle creatures-like they tried to eat him. In return for me saving him, he agreed to build a time museum. I get the feeling that he's come here for another reason, as he's mentioned more than a few times that New Leaf City has an interesting role to play in the future. Maybe you can find out a bit more...
9201050_PRESSING_UP=Heh, I asked the same thing when I saw the Professor building them. They're warp points. Pressing Up will warp you to another location. I recommend getting the hang of them, they're our transport system.
9201050_MONSTER_INFESTED=The MesoGears are beneath Bigger Ben. It's a monster-infested section of Bigger Ben that Barricade discovered. It seems to reside in a separate section of the tower-quite strange if you ask me. I hear he needs a bit of help exploring it, you should see him. Be careful though, the Wolf Spiders in there are no joke.
9201050_OUTSKIRTS=Ah...well. The Krakian Jungle is located on the outskirts of New Leaf City. Many new and powerful creatures roam those areas, so you'd better be prepared to fight if you head out there. It's at the right end of town. Rumors abound that the Jungle leads to a lost city, but we haven't found anything yet.
9201050_ANCIENT_TECH=Well, when John found himself in the MesoGears portion of Bigger Ben, he stood on one and went to another location. However, he could only head back and forth-they don't cycle through like the Foxwit Door. Ancient tech for you.
9201050_WE_ARE_ALWAYS_BUILDING=Well, you'll see them just about everywhere. They're areas under construction. The Red lights mean it's not finished, but the Green lights mean it's open. Check back often, we're always building!
9201050_TOO_COOL_FOR_SCHOOL=Ah, Jack. You know those guys that are too cool for school? The ones who always seem to get away with everything? AND get the girl? Well, that's Jack, but without the girl. He thinks he blew his chance, and began wearing that mask to hide his true identity. My lips are sealed about who he is, but he's from Amoria. He might tell you a bit more if you ask him.
9201050_REKINDLED_FRIENDSHIP=I've known Lita for a while, though we've just recently rekindled our friendship. I didn't see her for quite a bit, but I understand why. She trained for a very, very long time as a Thief. Matter of fact, that's how we first met! I was besieged by a group of wayward Mushrooms, and she jumped in to help. When it was time to pick a sheriff, it was a no-brainer. She's made a promise to help others in their training and protect the city, so if you're interested in a bit of civic duty, speak with her.
9201050_HARD_AT_WORK=Soon, my friend. Even though you can't see them, the city developers are hard at work. When they're ready, we'll open them. I know you're looking forward to it and so am I!
9201050_NO_PROBLEM=No problem. I'll give you something nice if you answer them correctly!
9201050_EXPLORE_A_BIT_MORE=Eager, are we? How about you explore a bit more before I let you take the quiz?

9201105_PROGRESS_IS_SPLENDID=So far your progress is splendid, good job. However, to make it to the Keep, you must face and accomplish this ordeal, carry on.
9201106_FROM_FAR_AWAY=I came from far-away places looking for people powerful enough to join my expedition against the evil that lays waste on this land. Are you, by any chance, one of those people?
9201107_UNBELIEVABLE=Unbelievable strength and power, anyone can be achieve. But what makes a warrior special is their iron will. No matter the odds, a true warrior pushes through until victory is assured. Thus, the Warrior Chamber is a brutal road where the room itself is against you, as well as the ultra-strong monsters within. Use your skills to shake off the effects and defeat the monsters within to reach the Warrior Statue and claim the Master Sword. Good luck!
9201107_LEGENDARY_FAMILY_OF_HEROES=A legendary family of heroes, the de Vrisiens are the original founders of the Storm Casters. The family is unique, as each son or daughter inherits the full fighting techniques of their ancestors. This ability has proven to be immensely useful; as it allows for nearly unlimited strategy, improvisation and tactics to defeat all enemies. A true family for the generations.
9201107_GOOD_JOB=Good job.

9201107_ELIMINATE_ALL=Eliminate all Crimson Guardians.
9201108_LEGENDARY_CREATURE_AWAITS=A legendary creature known as the Master Guardian awaits you. It was a Crimson Guardian that Ridley once experimented on, which resulted in its becoming highly resistant to magic attacks, spears, maces, everything--except arrows fired with exceptional power. Bowmen and women! As undisputed masters of the Bow and Arrow, you must use your most powerful attacks--everything from Strafe to Hurricane to Piercing Arrow to destroy this powerful creature and reach the Bowman Statue to claim The Ancestral Bow! Good luck!
9201108_MOST_FAMOUS_HEROES=One of the only known Holy Archers, Lockewood is one of the Keep's most famous heroes. Of particular note is his custom white and gold battle barb, said to be blessed by a powerful goddess. His aim was tremendously accurate over long distances. Feared and respected for his 'Genesis Arrow' and 'Doom Phoenix', he once struck down six Typhons from the Valley of Heroes.
9201108_GOOD_JOB=Good job.
9201108_MAKE_ETC_ROOM=Make room on your ETC inventory first.

9201108_ELIMINATE_ALL=Eliminate all Master Guardians.
9201109_QUALITY_WIZARD=As a powerful Elite Magician, Ridly knew the value of intelligence, the hallmark quality of a wizard. Thus, the Mage Chamber is a twisting maze of devious conception--the Teleport skill is the only skill you can use inside to get around, and Magic Claw is the only skill that will break the statues. You must also kill numerous monsters within. After you solve the maze and defeat all the foes within it, deduce which Mage Statue hides the Staff of First Magic and break it open to claim it! Good luck!
9201109_EXCEPTIONALLY_SKILLED_SORCERER=A name forever remembered, Rafael was an exceptionally skilled sorcerer, and the foremost master of mental magic powers, telekinesis and telepathy. In addition to that, he was one of the 'Elite Magicians' who mastered all the elements.

9201110_ONLY_GET_TO_WITH_HASTE=As every Thief knows, the best attack is the one you never see coming. So, to best illustrate this, you'll be in a chamber with platforms and ledges that you can only get to with Haste, as well as All-Seeing Eyes that your dagger or claw must close--permanently. After all the All-Seeing Eyes have been eliminated, get ti the Thief Statue and lay claim to the Primal Claw! Good luck!
9201110_ABILITY_TO_BLEND=Once known as the 'Prince of Shadows', Grandmaster Ryo possessed supreme speed and power with short-ranged daggers and longer chain-like Claw. A part-time member of the Boss Hunters, he was renowned for unparalleled ability to blend into the very night itself. His legend grew during a battle with Crimson Balrog, where he moved so swiftly that Balrog's attacks only caught air. Ryo also performed occasional 'retrievals' for those less fortunate than himself.

9201111_DIG_FOR_BOOTY=You're about to get wet and do what a Pirate does best--dig for booty! Be careful--that water beneath is known as Heavy Water, and it's so dense that I doubt you could swim through it! You'll have to make your way around....The relic you seek is known as the Forbidden Gun, which is an ancient weapon of the finest Pirate to grace the shores of Masteria--Steel Fist Jack! It's been buried in one of the many treasure chests you'll find below the sea. It won't be easy...Pirates were known for burying things in the most unlikely places, so dig deep and keep your guard up. There are sharks and much worse in those waters!
9201111_LONG_AGO=Long ago, a strange warrior washed upon the shores of Masteria. This being claimed to be a member of a mysterious band of warriors that used claw-like weapons and projectile-based artillery to defeat foes. Known as 'Steel Fist Jack', his cunning and trickery in battle was devilishly effective. He eventually built a boat and left the Keep in search of his former crew and captain.
9201112_NOT_STARTED=The event isn't started...
9201112_MADE_IT_IN=Agh, you have made it in. Let me tell you real quick: they've caught us already. Master Guardians are about to come here in about a minute. We'd better hurry.

9201112_FIND_THE_PORTAL=You can find the portal somewhere around here... you'd better find it, quick. I'll catch up.
9201112_A_SUCCESS=That was a success! Now, for this path, I do believe we need one of every Adventurer class to get past.
9201112_USE_THEIR_SKILLS=They need to use their skills on each of these things called Sigils. Once all five have been done, we can get past.
9201112_TREAD_LIGHTLY=Now what we have here are more Sigils. At least five Adventurers have to climb to the very top and go through the portal. Stay aware though: not every wall or ground on this map is what it seems to be, so tread lightly!
9201112_BEWARE_OF_TRAPS=Oh, and beware of these death traps: Menhirs. They really pack a punch. Good luck.
9201112_ALL_JOBS_MUST_FILL_ROLES=Now what we have here are more Sigils. However, some of them don't work. Here all jobs must fill their roles, as at least one of these Sigils are activated by their job skills, however there can be more than one per job, so be sure to test them all.
9201112_MERELY_A_DISTRACTION=These Stirges will get in your way, but they're merely a distraction. To get rid of them, get five adventurers to stand on the middle-left platform simultaneously. To pass, try every one of these Sigils until they work.
9201112_SURPRISED=Surprised you made it this far! What you see here is the statue of Crimsonwood Keep, but without any of it's weapons.
9201112_FIVE_ROOMS=There are five rooms, marked by a statue near each of them, around the statue.
9201112_SUSPECT_EACH_ROOM_HAS_A_WEAPON=I suspect that each of these rooms have one of the statue's five weapons.
9201112_BRING_BACK_THE_WEAPONS=Bring back the weapons and restore them to the Relic of Mastery!
